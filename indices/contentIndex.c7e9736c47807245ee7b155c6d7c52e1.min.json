I never had the chance to do an extensive work on the world but worked on it whenever I wanted to run away from the real world and get myself lost in my fantasy world.  That fantasy world opened up to a whole new vista when I shared the world with other people to play table top roleplaying games. \n\n2020 presented an interesting proposal I could not refuse, I was stuck at home like many of us and I had too much time to ask myself the questions I haven't been asking myself for years; How is my world doing? I also had an opportunity to run a lot of Dungeons and Dragons online with many groups and was able to reconstruct my world again and since I have more time I started to wonder whether I can write a short story about it.... But where do I start?\n\nWhat initially started as my new knowledge management system (KMS) ended up being used as my personal knowledge base for D\u0026D and all the lore I have created. [Obsidian](http:www.obsidian.md) is the said system and I fell in love with and the discord community. There I learned about [NaNoWriMo](http:www.nanowrimo.org) with their annual writing challenges and I decided to join the community to write something with a solid beginning and and end. \n\nThis website came to be to share some of my writings with my community, learn bit more about coding in my spare time and sharing some of my writing journey here.\n\n### First day of April FOOLS, I mean NaNoWriMO actually. \nI joined the [Virtual Write-in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utW1-FHDTOE\u0026t=5s\u0026ab_channel=NaNoWriMo), thank you Katherine for the wonderful facilitation, to learn more about what is going on during the writing camp. It was a bit daunting at first but nonetheless exciting to participate in my first group writing sessions without feeling like this is some sort of essay I have to turn for an English exam. English is my second language and writing is my nemesis for my entire academic life, and still is today. Curse you articles why thou art exist? But the facilitation was smooth and the topics were refreshing for me to think about what I'm going to write - not entirely - to think from my potential character's perspective with writing prompts. I clocked in 800+ words in on the story I wanted to develop on. Plus the side writing I did that was not part of the project scope it slowly rolled towards 2000 words today in total. I never tracked how many words I write a day on a daily basis other than just writing it for fun for my D\u0026D so this was rather exciting to track it for once. As for my activity you can check out how I am doing [from here.](nanowrimo/202204/Introduction.md)\n\n### Reading List\nI am going rather slow since I am trying to read other books in the meantime to learn how to write and edit it going forward and the current books I'm reading are:\n1.

I honestly don't know how much time I spend on writing my own stories till I started. \n\nI'm starting to see there's some lag time when I write. I am trying to think about the structure and the direction but I can't seem to do that clearly. the guide asks what the goal of the scene is it's rather hard to nail it in the first writing especially with my approach of writing. What is my approach?\n\nI wrote some prompt yesterday and I thought it would be nice to continue on to build up on it. on both occasions I had to think for a bit before I was writing them and that was a good 3 to 5 min thinking before my fingers started to move to write them. Unlike yesterday today I was thinking to write them with some goal in mind, seed some misbelief in the protagonist but I struggled to come up with it and decided to just write down whatever that was coming to me and see what I ended up with. \n\nTurns out it's messy and all over the place as my brain wasn't thinking in a linear structure but it just constantly branches and I needed to make sure I write them down else I will forget and this made it really difficult for me to stay focused on the writing a clear flow of story. However I was able to flesh out the things around the story itself. It did take a while before I was able to nail down what the misbelief should be given to the protagonist and in the end it was refreshing to know that I can write about 600 words in about 30 minutes with some time slated for thinking. \n\n# D\u0026D is easier than writing, I swear.\nSo I run D\u0026D sessions on Mondays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Yes that is a lot and I love it. The biggest challenge would be coming up with the content and so far I only had handful of occasions where I was stuck with the content and asked for a break only once or twice in my 2 years, going third thanks covid, or running 4 to 5 campaigns a week. How you might ask? Well here's the reason why,\n\n## D\u0026D is a collaborative storytelling\nI'm not the sole writer of the story, my role as a game master (GM/DM) is to create a setting and conflict for the players to interact with and whatever happens happens. there fore I don't have to think about what each of actors on the setting are thinking about. Yes I do have to think about the non-player character (NPC) responses and personas and all but it's rather easier to craft them compared to what I am doing for the writing itself. Plus a lot of them are improv storytelling at the time of the session with some seeds so I do not plan the entire thing. Because if I plan too much then it feels scripted and feel like I should force the story to follow that script. \n\nThe other part of the equation of D\u0026D is the players they get to see the setting  and the conflict I have created and figure out ways to resolve them if they wish to or just leave it as is. \n\nTake today's group for instance, they're currently in a two island with five settlements each run by a cloud giant. They are going around to understand what is happening in each of the settlement and they have learned so far.\n\n- Voracious cloud giant - slave driver for incense sales and having issues with a group a religious group focusing on happiness\n- Warmongering cloud giant - frequently hosts blood sports to pick out raiders to raid neighbouring settlements to loot and looking for which settlement to raid.\n- Passive cloud giant - taking care of the people on his settlement and moving further inland to protect the people from warmongering sibling and the village is suffering from a magical plague.\n- Mercantile cloud giant - amasses wealth through trade with other islands to keep the village thriving and have hired foreigners to live in a city to protect his assets.\n- Religious cloud giant - yet to be revealed.\n\n There's no right answer what the players would be doing in the islands but they are thinking of what they are going to do to either help out the people in the islands by taking a side. Right now they're thinking of taking out some of the giants and help them to create a council of giants to unite them. As a GM I am talking to them out of character (OOC) to bounce ideas back and forth not to plot but to think about npc responses and checking with each of their goals to see if it aligns. ___My goal is to create an interesting story with them___. \n\n## Sometimes I do nothing, seriously nothing.\nSo it's a collaborative storytelling and sometimes, GM doesn't need to be involved at all to have fun. I'm just there to do some rulings on how things will be settled. Here's on example happened today.\n\nI have given the party a bag of tricks, which allows you to summon animals that lasts for a day or until killed, three times a day, in previous island expedition. One of the player asked about how does it work, where are those animals are from and where do they go once the duration expires. We had some discussions on what it might be and after some discussion we have collectively arrived that.\n\n- The bag of tricks have three spirits that will manifest in an animal form for a day at random, unless they're all summoned at once.\n\t- these spirits have personalities and they are Dumb / Haughty / Loyal inspired by the three hyenas from the Lion King. \n\nIt was all players discussion and I was steering the conversation in some directions and they make the calls and I just set that as the rules of the bag of tricks. \n\nIt's lot easier for me to write the setting and wait for the players to interact and fill in the gaps. I am struggling to write a short story based on my campaign settings and I'm spending most of my time on thinking about what is going on each of the character's head - **or I'm just overthinking it**.","lastmodified":"2022-04-21T09:06:27.023704507Z","tags":null},"/journal/2022-04-04":{"title":"2022-04-04","content":"I was never really taught on journaling, I just wrote them since I was seven and just let my thoughts wander and wonder to let the words flow on to the screen or to the paper. \n\none of the reasons why I enjoy this method is because I tend to sift and come to a new realization at the end of this random writing. Yes, if it's something I intended for you to actually read, I would put more effort in restructuring and make some grammar checks before posting this, however this is just where my thoughts just flow onto the screen. I just hope I'm making more sense before my eyes squint and start chiseling things out of the wall of text thinking there's better way to rephrase things. \n\nI did however read about different journaling methods as I've started to pick this ancient habit of mine as I thought there are better ways to do this and never bothered to explore the options. I've come across bullet journaling, while it's a great starter for people to start writing about what was done and what still needs to be done. Please do point out to me the benefits of doing this journaling in a long run because I am having a hard time justifying myself. Or I'm just stubborn to change.\n\nBut here's  my reason for doing this free flow writing for journaling and I hope it makes sense.\n\n## It takes a snapshot of me in this very moment.\nI will always be me but I change over time in small increments and over a long period of time, I will change for sure. Many years later I can read my old writings and look back to say 'huh so that's what I thought it was important in my life.' Every moment is precious and opportunity for reflection and journaling is a moment of reflection of the day. I feel if I leave what I did today would leave out what I think and feel about highlights of the day. \n\n## It's almost like a letter to myself in the future, if I ever read it.\nI moved to a new place about six months ago and stumbled across a box that hasn't been opened for two decades. The box was all worn out and needed to be discarded and its contents needed a new home, thus I took the contents out and turns out it's my old things I considered precious back in elementary school days. Journals were part of them. It was written in pencil and many of the writings were blurred out due to rubbing and just faded over time but I can still make out some of the things I wrote and sometimes it felt like it's something I was leaving it for my future self. There it was, a letter to myself in one of my journals. It was written when I was graduating from elementary school and writing to my future self in middle school with some expectations of the life and questioning what kind of memories I would make there. Past me, you have no idea how dull middle school life was, elementary school days were better with more carefree days. Too bad I can't send this to the past but enjoy the days in the sun while you can!\n\n## There's some sort of revelation from time to time.\nI don't write everyday but when I do, I try to think about what I felt or thought about something happened today. I think as I got older there's less time for me to think about my thoughts and having some conversation with them and journaling offered that space for me to have some understanding of my thoughts and feelings and their underlying causes. Mind you it's not hundred percent efficiency but it is better than not thinking about it. I come to terms with certain things lot faster when I talk to myself about some of the issues. As I'm writing I might come to a realization that I was not yet aware of. Right now, nothing is coming to me but I just remembered why I started writing this in the first place.\n\n## ROTFL I was so stupid today.\nThis is the main point of my writing today because I did find it funny after many hours and a lesson for me to remember.\n\nI enjoy going to Ikea and browse the second hand section to find random things that looks like something I can use for completely different purpose than its initial intention. I found a nice piece of board - I have no idea what it was part of nor the label said what it was - but somehow I envisioned I can use it as a keyboard tray, IF I have the sliding unit. So I browed the web to find on in amazon and ordered it and it finally arrived today. I skimmed over the instruction and spend decent hours on installing the thing, but I caught a snag. the tray was flimsy and kept falling off.\n\nUsually I would think that this would be my fault but this was a bit different and here's why. The kit came with no instructions and upon looking up online, I learned it didn't have enough screws for construction. Hence my respect for the product dropped a bit. I skimmed over the instruction and concluded I'm an adult and I am smart enough to make this without consulting a piece of paper. \n\nYou know where this is going. \n\nI made the whole thing and the tray was falling off and I couldn't figure out why and I concluded that it's the screws. I went through my own screws to replace them and still it was wabbly like a seesaw. I almost gave up but then I looked at the screws... turns out I had to assemble the tray's latching unit BEFORE mounting it. I looked at the manual and surely that was the order or assembly. I felt stupid. \n\nJust because the kit was missing some elements, the hubris took over and I suffered.\n\nNow I'm going to remind my future self to no matter what, always read the manual thoroughly, whether it's missing couple of screws or not.\n\nThere, another journal of what I did today and my lesson with some wisdom for my hopefully smarter wiser self in the distance future to read and laugh at myself.","lastmodified":"2022-04-21T09:06:27.023704507Z","tags":null},"/journal/2022-04-16":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"``---\ndate: 2022-04-16\ntitle: \"2022-04-16\"\nstatus: 🌱🪴🌲🍇\nwords:\ntags:\n- journal\n---\n\nWhy I didn't write today.\n\nSometimes it's just not my day when it comes to writing and yes if you haven't noticed I don't write my journals everyday not because I don't have anything to write but more like I was too busy to have my scream of conscious to be present. **I guess I wasn't present for about two weeks.** \n\nSo what did I do and any thoughts on it.\n\nI skimmed over The Art of War\nIt's complicated book to read at very least because depending on how you take the context, it's a quick read. On the other hand it's a deep read if you look into things. \n\nThe Short\nIt really isn't much other than his warfare tactics and what should regard as the utmost important things and order of operations based on strategic significance. 36 types of strategies to be precise.  I won't list them all but the main highlight is information is the key to minimal loss in warfare. That is Tzun Tzu's philosophy, **loss aversion.**\n\nThe Long (well it's still short)\nThese are my takeaways, not the what book says.\nPrepare for the Minimal Requirement\nThe world when the tactics were written and deployed is when warfare was done between lords of a single castle and most of the battle was between hodge podge of recruits who were mostly ill-equipped farmers and of course, poor training. Therefore the tactics were fundamental in terms of understanding and utilizing untrained soldiers. In a sense, treat everyone is untrained for the job and prepare for the minimal requirement, not the average.\n\nIt's all about resource management\nThere's extensive wisdom in Tzun Tsu regarding resource management and his sole focus is on minimal loss in all fronts. The famous \"Know your enemy\" is a party of a longer phrase regarding loss aversion; If you know yourself and the enemy, you will never suffer loss in a hundred battles. There are numerous aspects where they avoid certain terrains and positions to avoid loss of morale and food which majority of the tactics are based on. It is battle of attrition and understanding how to exhaust enemy's while preserving your own resources.\n\nInform then Disinform to Misinform\nThe biggest aspect of Tzun Tzu's philosophy is to know more than the others and keeping them in the dark as long as possible. First is to be informed about the situation through any means, preferably espionage and or observing the enemy from afar. Use disinformation to confuse and keep the opponents from knowing your true intentions and misinform them. The difference between disinform and misinform is one is intentional while the other may not be intentional but both results the same thing, wrong intel.

Oh course, the chore always come to me since my eldest sister Ren is too dainty, Ollie is too frail and I'm the most fit and the youngest.\n\nHowever this was not the rainy day I get to do some house chores but the day I took up on my sister's challenge and got lost in the woods. But before I get there there's something you need to know about my sister. \n\nRenarious Wiles, the eldest daughter of the Wiles family and the future mistress or wife to a man who is better off than my family. I think it was my father's disdain when he learned the first born was not a son. This fact was made clear to everyone in the family. I don't know whom he blames for this but he didn't waste time on his child upbringing and decided that she would be groomed to be a wife of another wealthier to strengthen the family's wealth, like his father did. So my sister Ren grew up rather spiteful but was well taught in manners and well versed in the local history to ensure she is desirable. \n\nBut Ollie and I knew, she was competitive and preferred to be less formal. She was given a doll while Ollie was given a sword. I was given a wooden tool set to learn about crafting. Ren demanded Ollie to teach her swordplay whenever she had the chance to be outside. \n\nIt was her 13th birthday when she was given a horse, to learn how to ride one along side Ollie since she demanded a lady should know how to ride a horse alongside her man. Father doted his daughter as much as he would for a bargaining chip and somehow this fancied him and he agreed. However, she quickly came to realization that horseback riding is something she did not excel. \n\nI was not given a horse, my family had wealth but not that wealthy. Instead, I was given a workhorse to take care of, it was a new born from the stables of work horses we already had for pulling wagons. I named her Marney, after my grandmother's familiar. Marney and I got along really well since I had her as a pony and I knew her quirks. She expressed her stress by strutting he left hind feet and one way of calming her down stroking her head just behind her right ear. I think Marney understood me as well. She always neighed and nodded when I was talking to her as if she would answer to my words. This helped me when I had a chance to learn to ride alongside my siblings, I spent more time with Marney to a point I didn't really need to learn how to use the reins. \n\nThis frustrated Ren. She ways already frustrated she was bested by Ollie and this is the first time she got something she wanted that is outside of what a proper lady would do. I think she enjoyed it but she wasn't as skilled in handling the horse. She was too focused on ordering the horse rather than to understand it.\n\n\"Race me.\" Ren blurted out to me after our lessons were over and the instructor left the stables.\n\"You know we're not suppose to ride after the lessons, besides they're tired from running around with us on their  backs. We can do that some other time.\" I rebutted.\n\"You will race me, Ollie's too worn out to ride anymore so you should do.\" Ren ordered and pointed at Ollie who was wiping the sweat off of his brows and barely controlling his breathing.\n\"Ren, Ben's right you shouldn't else father would get upset it we ride outside of lesson and supervision.\" He added but Ren was already picking up the saddle pushed it to my chest.\n\"Come on, it'll b short. Are you dismissing me because you're better than me?\"\n\"No, I think you're a good rider.\"\n\"Then race me.\"\n\"You don't have...\"\n\"I do and saddle her up, we can tour around the forest and first one to return wins.\"\n\"Ren, the forest is dangerous, there might be elves  nearby.\" Ollie mumbled.\n\"Those tree lovers won't come down this close to the village. You're afraid of meeting some wood elves? They won't come near the town, they haven't come down this area in ten years.\" She quelled Ollie's fear and she was right. The wood elves haven't come down this far down in recent years and we have never seen them, just stories of them coming down and kidnapping children those who don't listen to their parents.\n\"They might come to kidnap...\"\n\"Yes they would love to snatch you away Benny and feed you to the wolves! They're just saying that so you don't wander around too far. The forest is safe. Or are you afraid?\"  She goaded and I took it.\n\"I'm not afraid, I go to the forest everyday!\" I muttered a bit, covering my fear by clenching on the saddle in my hand. Marney huffed and shook her head, she knew.\n\"Great, you know the way around, so show me around the forest, while you prance around the forest I get to recite stupid poetry and walk around like a dainty little doll.\" she grabbed her horse's rein and stepped outside.\n\nThe clouds were gathering in the forest and the wind was whispering the weather's about to change. It is true I go to the forest almost everyday but that is only during fine days and always with by carpenter master. \n\"Ren looks like it's about to rain so why not.\"\n\"Get your dumb horse out here and show me around like a man.\"  Ollie and I exchanged glances, he shook his head. \n\nHowever some weird idea came up in my head. She was four years older than I so obviously she was smarter and stronger in every way, but I knew the forest and I know how to ride better than both of my siblings. I wanted to beat them in something for once. This was it. This was the chance to prove I am better than her in something. I patted Marney's side and tossed the saddle on her back, Marney looked up and shook her head.\n\n\"I know, help me prove that I can beat her in riding and I'll get you some carrots when the stable master's not looking,\" I coaxed her and it worked, her ears perked when she heard the word carrots and I led her outside. I double checked the saddle and gingerly got on.\n\nRen was already on her horse,  she used her silver tongue to get a horse when the instructor was recommending a pony to get started since she's young and has a small frame. I think her reasoning was,\n\n\"I am thirteen and Mrs. Bluemires informed I am ready to learn the etiquettes of the court and ready to present myself as a lady, hence I am a lady. A proper lady should ride a horse, not a pony, such would be disgraceful for a lady of Wiles.\"\n\nI would imagine that's about the way she went about it. The truth is more comical. she cannot mount the horse without a step ladder and her legs won't reach to the sides so she can't give a proper commands even if she wants to sprint.  The only saving grace is Petunia, her horse, named after the birthmark on her forehead that looks like petunia flower,  is the most calm horse in the Iron Glades she never throws a fit or panics, she gracefully trots in almost any situation and listens to the rider like it's the extension of their legs.\n\n%% Oh the catastrophe is the death of Petunia and they have to get out of the situation.%% \n\nRen nodded when I joined her at the open field staring at the forest to the north.\n\"You ready?\"\n\"No\"\n\"Good!\" \nRen kicked off like the wind, or at least Petunia did. I did catch the glimpse of my sister's unfettered glee filled with joy and excitement compared to her usual muted expression at home. This is the real Ren. This is the Ren she bottles up in the house and only reveal when she's our parents. I came to my sense and chased after her to the forest with Marney.\n\nThe air in the forest was heavier than usual, perhaps its' the weather but there was something else to it. I could feel someone was watching from a distance and the moment I turn my head to confirm the feeling disappeared. Ren paid no heed and was dashing through the bush recklessly. Her horse was keen on finding where the next solid footing should be before stepping. Marney on the other hand took her time and had the patience or uncertainty to double check her steps.\n\n\"Marney we're losing her, we could follow her steps instead.\" I conjectured but Marney flapped her eyes and shook adamantly as if to say she's not Petunia. Marney was still a pony, a work pony. She's got the power but not the grace nor the speed, and Petunia had all three. It wasn't long Ren's bright brown silhouette blended into foliage and vanished from the view. \n\nWe followed the tracks and kept our watchful eyes on the surroundings, the eerie stare from the  distance continued to chase us and whenever I looked in the direction, the feeling faded. The tracks were clear but it was heading further up north, nearing the border of the borders. Beyond would mean entering the area of wood elves. \n\n\"Sister?\" I shouted but only the silence replied, not even the birds sang.  ^6fb490\n\n[[nanowrimo/202204/Milestone Scene 2 - draft 1 - Part 2]]","lastmodified":"2022-04-21T09:06:27.023704507Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/Milestone-Scene-2-draft-1-Part-2":{"title":"Milestone Scene 2 - draft 1 - Part 2","content":"![[nanowrimo/202204/Milestone Scene 2 - draft 1#^6fb490]]\n\nThe trees around me grew taller and grew teeth and claws, it began to stare down at me and the trunks started to crowded near me as if they are closing in. Marney kept her calm coming to a slow stop in the middle of the encircle. I tightened the grip on the reins, I could feel the stare and distant whispers of sort. I felt my shudder from fear and paralyzed neck down. I started to sweat. It must be them. The elves. \n\n\"Marney we need to go after Ren,\" I mumbled and Marney took few steps back and slowly turned around. I think she knew exactly what was going on. my breathing got faster s the forest closed in on me and all I could do is hold onto Marney with my dear life. Trust she can take me out of this place.\n\nThen the silence broke as a dark figure from the forest lunged and broke through the thickets. I braced myself for impact. Instead, long auburn hair broke the paralysis gripped my body. It was Ren. She was covered in scratches and her dress was torn from running through the bush. She abruptly stopped in front of me. I could hear the labored breathing from Ren and Petunia. \n\n\"Ben, snap out of it. We're leaving,, now,\" She ordered and I blanked out and Marney neighed as if she understood her words. Ren's presence did war my fingertips and shaking stopped but I was still stiff as a plank. \n\n\"Useless... Ben, wake up. There's something in the forest and it doesn't want us here,\" She explained calmly and came closer to brush my hair and held my stiff hands. Her hands were warm and soft but I felt mild shaking as well. She, too, was afraid of what was going on around. Ren kept her cool about it, maybe because I was here or did it to dispel the dread looming over out head. She grabbed the rein from my hands and whipped Marney with it. the work pony started advance slowly and picked up the pace and Petunia lead the way. \n\nThe sun was staining the sky orange by the time we existed the forest and greeted with men with lanterns. Out father was among them, furious  and even more once he saw us. Ren and I were in a sorry state but Ren had it worse, torn dress and scratches. I was relatively fine since Marney took careful strides in the forest to avoid any scratches. \n\n\"Explain yourselves,\" Our father demanded back at the stables. I've never seen him this angry before. The last time he was this mad was when Ollie broke his leg from a fall while we were playing guards and bandits. I was grounded for weeks and did chores around the house while my brother recovered. Ren already changed and her scratches were covered with herbal balms. I was still in the same clothing, sitting by the fire with holding onto a wooden mug with hot water. Ren and I exchanged glances. \n\n\"Ben wanted to explore the forest.\"\n\n\"Why did you not stop him?\"\n\n\"I wanted too as well until he got scared and we got lost in the woods. We came back alive and well so all is well?\" Ren made it sound like a question mark. *That's not how it happened*, I interjected in my head, instead I gave Ren a look of confusion. Older sister did not bat an eye at me. \n\n\"Watch your tongue, not all is well. Both of you disobeyed the rule of not entering the forest unattended. You know the place is close to the elven border and rumors of them taking children,\" Father rubbed his temples and kneeled to Ren to inspect her balm covered face. He must be wondering whether there will be scars on her face.\n\n\"The high courting starts in two weeks, and you need to look your best. no blemishes. And you child. I expected you to be more disciplined than your elder sister.\"\n\nI looked at my father and opened my mouth to think of a good response, especially the truth. Then my sister spoke before me.\n\n\"Do not punish him father, he merely wanted to prove his riding skills. You should have seen him, he wove through the thicket, unlike clumsy me. And worry not father, these scars are light and won't leave any scratch. Perhaps the imperfection would be something to be desired, an element that requires taming by my future suiter.\" \n\n\"Tongue daughter, is this true?\" He inquired me and I saw a glimpse of Ren staring at me with a nod. I should answer honestly else only I would get in trouble. At the same time I know I won't be able to speak my way out against my older sister. She's four seasons ahead of me but her oration is leagues ahead of me. The most likely outcome would be more severe punishment should I speak up against her and father usually prefers her over me. I fiddle my thumbs around the mug and slowly nod.\n\nFather lets out a long drawn out sigh, combing his hair back and stands up.\n\n\"No more horseback riding for both of you. Benarious help out stablemaster until the end of the moon after your apprenticeship with carpenter Melk.  Be grateful of your sister came to rescue you.\"\n\nI just blankly looked up before father stood up and left the stables, Ren loosened her posture and started to tie her hair.\n\n\"Thanks for sticking with my story,\" She thanked.\n\n\"You owe me.\"\n\n\"Yea, but I knew you wouldn't. I'm sure part of the things I said were true.\"\n\nShe was right about the proving my skills, perhaps the only thing I'm good at. I didn't want her to be right.\n\n\"You're wrong. \"\n\n\"Bet your pony Marney that you are proud of your pony and better at handling them.\"\n\nI did not answer.\n\nFather's punishment was mild, in a sense it was more of a reward as I had more time in the stables with Marney. Whatever happened in the forest I don't think I would have gotten out without her back then and she's the only reliable being in the household.","lastmodified":"2022-04-21T09:06:27.023704507Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/Protagonist-design-Ben-Wiles":{"title":"Protagonist design - Ben Wiles","content":"## Physical description\nThe protagonist of my [[nanowrimo/202204/Introduction|2022 April NaNoWriMo]] short story. \n\nHe's a human male with height 5'7\" with short dark brown hair with hazel eye with lightly tanned skin with weight of 154 lb with not so appealing square body shape.\n## Personality\nBen is observant with keen interest in understanding what the other's true intentions because he assumes people are not to by trusted but not so much for the animals.

Actually, it was made for the folks around here, the owner of this place barely came to my waist, and I had to wiggle myself  to sooth my discomfort. But I continued to hum as I would be going home tomorrow morning once this rain passes over the Berryglen and I would be homebound with the goods I have traded here, it's not much but it'll be far more than what I have expected to get from this far away place. I took a moment of pause and looked at the itiniary and a small sketch of the road alongside the list. I could not help but to smile with how lucky I was to come to this place and able to trade rather mundane goods at a premium.\n\nBerryglen is a remote place up in north far from strife between wood elves, humans, lizardfolks and other undelightful beings. The folks here are stout, very stout but not as broad as the gold loving dwarves. They call themselves heartfolks but we call them halflings. This remote place seem like has yet seen any sort of conflict despite there's a small human fort settlement about a week's travel my horse. They don't have a concept of coins and uses bartering to trade goods and services as if everyone here would keep their honest words. Naivety. I was once like them but not anymore. I came here to trade some of the tools that would fit their hands better than standard tools and due to their demand for tools I was able to get a discount on getting some of the things they didn't need, honey and wax. the quality here is great compared to the ones I have seen in my hometown and I basically traded for free for the things I traded. I was in luck.\n\nWhat I did not realize my luck ran out the night the rain gently strummed the roof of the Majectic Yew.\n\nThe serenity broke when a halfling drenched in rain barged in. Two halflings, a female and a male, entered and took off their soaked hooded cape and hung behind their chairs.\n\"Jerena something warm and room for five would you?\" The female halfling waved her hand with a gruff tone.  He had a rough expression looked like she was looking for trouble, especially if they deny her request. Meanwhile the male halfling slouched back on the chair with an audible sigh of relief. \n\nI wondered who the other three are, and they answered.\n\nThe door was left open and the other two entered, two tall figures about my height also drenched in rain. One of them took off and it was a young human girl. Her expression was bright as summer day and approached the fireplace and was kindly engaging with the elder by the fireplace. She was talking to them and hung her cape and gestured at the elder by placing her right hand on her left collar bone. Her braided auburn hair and olive eyes indicated she might be from the same area as I am. But her gesture and the braided hair disturbed me, those are elven gestures and humans shouldn't do such things.  Her companion took off his hood and my body tensed up, he was a wood elf.\n\nThe elf had the same braided jet black hair and cold gray gaze surveyed the establishment. His eyes stopped at me, the only other human and out eyes met. His gaze was like a predator's, assessing me like his prey. Then he turned his attention to the girl.\n\nShe must be his... I subconsciously placed my right hand on my waist where my dagger is. \n\n\"Izzy, let me get your cape, finally somewhere warm!\" the girl waltzed over and took his cape before the elf gave her a response. She hung his cape beside hers and our eyes met.\n\n\"How many times have I told you not to call me that,\" the elf scowled and replied with his soft low voice, not what I was expecting from a predator. the girl didn't ignored his words and joined the other two halflings on the table next to me. our eyes met and the girl brightly smiled and sat beside the slouched halfling and the elf sat against the wall beside the rough halfling.\n\nAs they sat down I noticed the human and the elf had matching quiver on their side with strange wooden belt around their waist. My eyes started to observe the girl to see if she has some sort of mark of slave or sort. My search was in vain and had to focus on looking down as I felt the cold gaze from the elf.\n\n\"Dae's blood, cursed I'd say,\" the female halfling spat her words.\n\n\"At least we made out alive sister,\" the male halfling whimpered while staring up at the ceiling.\n\n\"Yes we are alive and broke, left all behind because we couldn't carry any of them with us in such a short notice.\"\n\n\"None of us knew the goblins would raid the port like that and my goods weren't\"\n\n\"No, but you traded all your gems for what, some stupid seaweed and now they're all back in the port!\" \n\n\"Thimble, calm down I still have some left in my pocket...\" the male halfling pulled out his deflated pouch with a cut at the bottom. \n\n\"I'm going to strangle you Higs...\" Thimble stood up to reach her fingers for Hig's throat, only to be stopped by the girl. \n\n\"Well I'm sure Domalin has some idea.\" the girl interjected with an awkward smile looking over at the elf in the corner for some help but the elf merely watched.\n\nBut hold on, they just escaped from goblins, from the port. The nearest port I know is Ringbay. It could be another port, they have not mentioned the name. The last time I was there, there was no  mention of potential raid. \n\n\"Excuse me, did you say goblins raided a port?\" I glanced over the elf, he was eyeing on me, before raising the question at the table.\n\n\"Yup, what's it to you?\" Thimble barked, relenting her half hearted pursuit of Hig's throat.\n\n\"I plan on traveling up there,\"\n\n\"Not happening, nope. \"\n\n\"Care to exchange some details?\" I leaned towards the the halfling, and noticed the elf and the girl had their hands on their sword hilt and I relaxed my hand from my knife. They mirrored their hand motion. \n\n\"After you.\" Thimble rolled her hands.\n\n'I'm clearly in the disadvantage here. I'm sure as a halfling she may know more about these areas better than I would. I already procured the goods and I could sell that information since I collected them all. But I might risk being robbed by them should they find out. Perhaps I should trade some of my Distance coins instead?'\n\n\"How about a coin from Port Distance, it has fair share of silver.\"\n\n\"I thought we're exchanging details not selling details,\" Higs jumped in on the conversation and Thimbles leaned back on her chair with a grin.\n\n'I'm clearly out numbered and out witted, I have to keep an upper hand somehow,'  I concluded and started to inspect Higs. He was playing with a small pebble in his grimy fingers. My eyes darted around, no visible armor, layers of cloth, loose cuffs and flannels and sash with no discernable pouches. No trinkets, rings nor jewelry whatso ever. Either he's hiding himself or he is dirt poor and I think it's the former since they talked about gems earlier. Higs arched his brows and wrinkles over his forehead showed at least he's seasoned but his slack-jawed made it look he hasn't really accumulated the wisdom.\n\n\"How much do you know about apiary?\"\n\n\"Is it a place, like library?\" \n\n\"Somewhat, it's a place where you keep bees to collect honey and wax.\" I smirked at his response.\n\n\"Oh a bee hive, why didn't you say so.\" He lightly chuckled.\n\n\"It's been a good year for crops in these areas and the bee hives are full of honey and wax. If you can get your hands on some of those, the human settlements would trade you hefty sum of goods for them to survive the coming winter.\" Higs kept his intrigued look and nodded.\n\n\"Great, too bad the Ringbay burned about a week ago.\" Higs yawned and leaned back on the chair.\n\n\"Interesting information, what would you like to know in return?\" A new voice joined in and I gawked at the dwarf with an ornate chest in his hands. \n\n\"Thank you Jerena, some hearty meal please bread with honey and some goat cheese have them. And room...\"\n \n\"I've asked already.\" Thimble cut in.\n\n\"Could count on you Thimble.\" the dwarf chuckled and joined the table.\n\n\"Wish I could say the same for you.\" Thimble scoffed and the dwarf frowned at her response. \n\n\"That stings, after all that travel and surviving with just skin on our backs I thought you and I have finally come to an understanding.\"\n\n\"My understanding is that you now owe me fifty five silver pieces and more for getting you of burning town.\" \n\n\"Sharp as ever, but I believe we owe our lives to these two fine hunters who protected us more than your fist and chain could have.\" the dwarf pointed at the elf and the girl. \n\nThe dwarf carried some weight to his presence, his receding rustic hair and fiery beard was contained with some bronze tubes with anvil engravings. He wasn't all that tall, about a head taller than the halflings but seemed heavier, and the chair definitely confirmed with its loud creek when he sat on one. What caught my attention was his right hand. He was wearing a leather glove that went up to his elbow and looked lot bulkier than his left arm. \n\n\"Domalin, pleasure meeting you.\" He reached out and out of habit I shook his hand.\n\nThey say a hand shake speaks about the person. First to reach out and  firmness of the hand shake talks about how assertive the person is. The gripping strength and turning talks about whether he wants to intimidate or diplomatic. But I get something more from a handshake time to time, a tingling sensation around my fingertips. So far such sensations have been a bad ones. \n\nDomalin's hand  felt like a statue and made my fingertips tingle.  I don't like dwarves.\n\n\"Ben,\"  I answered back.\n\n[[Scene 1 first draft part 2]]","lastmodified":"2022-04-21T09:06:27.023704507Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/Scene-1-first-draft-part-2":{"title":"Scene 1 first draft part 2","content":"Goal: Ben joins Domalin's group\n\nI sat in front of the dwarf and felt like I'm about to enter a duel of board game with him and in fact that's how I exactly saw it. \n\n\"pleasure to meet you mister Ben and based on your looks you're not a bee keeper.\" Domalin grinned and looked over the kitchen and the fireplace where other halflings are.\n\n\"Was it the height and you're not an arkwright from the looks of it\" I joined the table  laid my sight on the ornate chest on the table.\n\n\"Everyone's a critic, but this one will fetch a good fortune once we deliver it.\"\n\n\"Give us a result and maybe I'll change my mind.\" Thimble cut in but her hand gets slapped away from the chest in Domalin's arms.","lastmodified":"2022-04-21T09:06:27.023704507Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/Scene-1-outline":{"title":"Scene 1 outline","content":"Ben is humming about his latest success in a trade and planning himself about the trip back to Port Distance and learns about the war break out to the north and blocking his path to back home by the way he came from.

Geese popped her head out of the urn, surveyed her surroundings and let out a white steam from her lips. The forest was fast asleep in her eyes but she knows it's wide awake, ever watching, like her mentor, Ishyldr. Always be at an advantage he taught her and she looked up. A dark silhouette on a large tree branch. She attempted to snuck beneath him but the cold moonlight and chilly wind offered no leeway.\n\nGeese noticed his bow was strung and an arrow resting on it, ready to be drawn. She also noticed, faint, a dark sag under his eyes.\n\n\"Get back inside sapling.\"\n\nHer face soured and glared up at the elf. She hated that word. It made her feel small and powerless. She's not the same little girl when he found her all those years ago. Yet, he still calls her sapling.\n\n“Seventh day in a row, I can cover tonight.\" She spat her words to wash off the sourness in her mouth.\n\n“I am fine, despite the sayings and numbers, the orcs are formidable.” \n\nExpected. she kept her gaze fixated on his eyes, he was looking over the forest and the sags under his eyes seemed to darken further.\n\n“You heard from Edith, they’re deserters. They're trying to leave and we even offered them food.” Geese rebutted and climbed the tree. He left no trace for her to follow but she managed.\n\n“Sapling, deserters have no honor. that's why they desert.”\n\nGeese gritted her teeth as she was climbing up to his branch. It wasn't the climbing, it was his words that bit her.\n\n“I haven’t seen you sleep in days. We’re no longer in the warzone and you can relax, for once.” She forced her tone to be as calm as possible, she wished he could be more warm to her when she cared for him. but he's always like this. \n\n“It’s still not safe with orcs and goblins abound. I can have my rest when we reach the town tomorrow.” She caught his eyes glancing at her. Geese flustered, quickly dusted the bark chips off of her hand and composed herself before leaning casually against the tree trunk.\n\n“Get some rest. I can handle this, it also means you don’t stand in front of Dee… guild master’s room.” her lips twitched mentioning Deet, casting her gaze down at the urn. \nThis isn't the first time Ishyldr protected someone but this time it's different. He's been forced to protect someone because of the curse. Something about that idea twisted her insides.\n\nThe guild master was not at fault but Geese couldn't help herself. She was so happy when they showed up to rescue her at the goblin's camp at the Western Gates of Kupferkrone but it soured once she learned her mentor was cursed while she was taking care of Edith. \n\n“Until we get to Vith, I should be … vigilant in protecting our guild master.”\n\n“Nobody’s telling you to guard her, nor she wants you to, I’m sure.” her words trailed towards the end, keeping her gaze fixated at the urn.\n\n“Correct, it is my own volition. You weren’t there when our guild master almost got killed.” Ishyldr kept his composure and Geese lost it; She scrambled her hair furiously. She knew his words were forced. She wished the golden hummingbird would whisper in her ears on how to break the curse or the god of woods to grant her the divine touch to cleanse him. \n\nBut no. She knew no such rites to commune with neither of the twin gods. The one thing her mentor never taught her because he wanted Geese to walk her own path when it came to faith. She always felt like she was being denied learning part of him. Tonight that resentment was at its peak. Geese lifted her chin to stare at her mentor and protector.\n\n“Kenari[^1], your hunter’s senses are sharp as a crescent moon but in some other areas.” She didn’t finish her sentence. This caught him off guard.\n\n“It’s been a while since you called me that, sapling.” \n\nHe could read creatures of the woods like a book while he could never figure out what was on her mind. This night was no different. She lided her eyes to quell her bubbling frustration and continued once those bubbles subsided.\n\n“I thought calling you by the formal name would be better to talk about this. I would like you to address me as such.” She cleared her throat.\n\n“Very well, my Nemandi[^2]. Shall we discuss on the ground?” Ishyldr puts the arrow away and gestured to the ground below. Geese nodded and jumped down with a roll to soften her landing. Her mentor took a side step on the tree trunk and rolled on the grass without a sound. \n\nBoth were now under the moonlight and she could clearly see him; slender body covered with brown padded clothing with patches of leather pieces on the joints dyed in dark green. a slender quiver and longsword on his sides now holstering his unstrung bow. His flawless long black hair that skirts around his weapons suddenly reminded of her hair and herself and she felt blood rushing through her ears. she lightly bit her lip with a sharp sigh and fixed her hair.\n\nHe just stood there silently, waiting for her to start.  He gave her the space to fix her hair. It made her happy but also sad because she knew he's smiling at his student, a child. \n\n“I think you’re unwell, Kenari. You are obsessed with our guild master as if she’s your prey. You don’t leave her out of your sight. There’s a curse on you and we are all worried for your body and soul.”\n\n“How would you like me to behave otherwise?” Ishydr’s gray gaze barreled down at her. Geese returned with the same intensity with her olive eyes.\n\n“Rest.” \n\n“And leave you to the sentinel post?” \n\n“Yes.”\n\n“You think you can stand against five raiders?”\n\n\"There will be no raid.\" \n\n\"And where does such faith swell from?\"\n\nHer lips pursed to say 'Trust me.' but only steam came out.\n\n\"Why are you making it so difficult? Am I such a burden to you? Am I that useless? to be taken care of, stand on the side away from the line of fire while you put your life in the death’s clutch?\"\n\n\"Nemandi, do you recall when we first met? under the moonlit night such as tonight among the pile of corpses of your family? Do you recall the words I spoke back then?\"\n\n\"Am I still a child to you?!\"\n\n\"I held your frail body and wept and told you in elven; I will protect you till I draw my last breath. I thought I lost you when the orcs took you.\"\n\n\"So after all these years, I'm still not good enough for you?\" Geese's eyes glistened and tears rolled down her cheeks.\n\n\"Am I not good enough because I'm not like you? I didn't get the blessing of the elven god? That I will perish centuries before you?\"\n\nIshyldr took a good look at Geese and she suddenly remembered when she saw his face for the first time under the moonlight, the night he spoke of. He was just as fair as back then, not a single thing has changed about him, unlike her. But that night, his face was wrecked in pain and was crying as he held her tightly in his arms. Tonight she saw something similar in his face.

She wasn't sure what to make of his words but crying on his shoulder quelled her bubbling anger.\n\n\"I will heed your suggestion and retire for the night. There will be no raid from orcs, hence you should sleep sound as well.\" He stated meekly, She wasn't sure why the sudden change of his attitude and such tone but she did not want to lose this opportunity. \n\nShe squeezed him tightly and pulled herself away from him.

The merchant wasn't telling them the truth. The merchant squinted and disregarded Ben's comment and Ben's persistence angered Kenneth, he informed Ben is misbehaving and the gold ingot passed all the usual tests, the scratch test and weight. He insisted but he was scolded and escorted out of the negotiation by Ollie and the transaction happened without him. \n\nLater they find out the gold bar was magically modified, it had lead and weight was modified by the use of magic to behave like one. \n\n:: I think the transaction should be a barter between something against the gold as they were out of Port Distance and the port distance's coins would be ineffective in  where they are meaning they might be somewhere far up north  near the mountainside by the mining area for the gold ingots for probably for something else,  Essienfort reserves perhaps? I think the other merchant is a dwarf or something so it seeds the whole doubt about meeting Domalin in the scene itself and he hasn't seen an honest dwarf merchant in this life::\n\nKenneth sealed the deal and took the ingot back to Port Distance sell it for other trade goods with Lawrence Trading Company only to learn what Ben was saying was true but he never finds out the significant loss of the trade :: I think about 10% loss? ::.\n\nWhat would have happened to Ben? I think he would have been punished somehow for talking to the adults and speaking out of turn in a serious negotiation. This in turn makes him he doubts himself about his intuition despite it's the right choice and this is due to him being attuned to the weaving ::magic:: but he's not aware of it. the connection is due to his grandfather is a weaver and is able to use it for his own benefits.  The last name isn't really a thing but it was given to the family due to this grandfather with his schemes, perhaps it's a good or bad thing but it's there and Lugris used it liberally to a point that it got stuck. But now he's old now and it's just who knows whether you can believe this old man setting in more ways than none. Plus he doesn't weave as much as others would, it's not like he is able to weave it perfectly other than some parlor tricks and the family doesn't really consider themselves to be a weaver nor they have it in the family. \n\n::This could be a lie in the world where everyone can weave but they need to be trained or requires a foci for them to perform one or just straight up weaving is dangerous the easiest way to weave is through devotion and oath to a patron.::\n\n**The goal for this background is for him is to have a misbelief to not to trust his intuition of weaving but more on his head. This builds up to the lie of trusting people as he would steel himself to think about other's true intentions behind their actions.** \n\nThe fact that is his relationship with Ollie is tenuous as is and this just exasperates even further since Ollie stays in because he's being trained to be the successor to the family trade while Ben was a tag along and a gopher for errands. :: age might be in his 14 or so?::\n\nThen the solidification of not trusting someone would be falling in love with someone as Ben would have more freedom to explore whatever he wants to do compared to Ollie and Ren?","lastmodified":"2022-04-21T09:06:27.023704507Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/day-4-protagonist-misbelief-ideation":{"title":"Ben's misbelief ideation, day 4","content":"# what would be the goal for this writing today?\n- Ben believes no people can b trusted but animals they are honest \n- this is where he solidifies Marney is his only true friend.\n- there should be some sort of betrayal from a humanoid that would break his trust but the animal companion would not.\n\t- would this be something along the lines of abandonment in a desperate situation while the Marney pulled through alongside Ben and he is able to get out of the situation? \n\t- would he be able to use his weaving to get out of the situation or would this ruin the situation?\n\t\t- from my exploration I have defined that Ben would be a unraveler, one who is good at dispelling tapestries of magic easier than others but he is untrained and mostly good at understanding its patterns rather than destroying them. \n\t\t\t- These are rare and not many are there who are keen on this skill to train Ben at this point in time - he would require a mentor should he learn this skill. But not right now for this segment of the story. \n- I think the betrayal might be Renarious, his older sister who abandons him not because she wanted to but due to situation\n\t- but why and what caused her to abandon him? is it something small or something rather dire?\n\t- who is Renarious? \n\t\t- She's the eldest, being born as the firstborn she's been forced to be the bargained off for strengthening the family's power by marrying someone with influence in the Port Distance, Kenneth Wiles would be doing such as his father has done and how his wife,  Merona Overglade is like.\n\t\t- She's been trained to be submissive but in fact she's got quite a spiteful and manipulative, like her father's carbon copy. If she's not manipulating people then she would be planning to do so to benefit her.\n\t\t\t- She gets jaded about her future and openly pretends to accept but looking for her freedom and control over her destiny\n\t\t\t- would she have some magical powers? would this person be Destiny????\n\t\t\t\t- would she run away? no she wouldn't be.\n- So it's a conflict between Renarious and Benarious with Marney involved. I think the story would be she wanted to race against Ben but loses and she does get spiteful and decides to pull a prank on him but gets out of hand by something happens.\n\t- what is that something? - let's find out by keep typing it out - did they get trapped somewhere due to Ren's recklessness but it's covered by her external persona to hide behind? \n\t\t- Who knows Ren's real persona? Ben and Ollie? perhaps. probably so this builds up on the context.\n\t\t- so they're stuck somewhere due to the fact that Ren overdid something and Ben followed her being the eldest but in the end Ben takes all the blame because Ren puts blame on him instead of her. \n\t\t\t- this would have happened when they were quite young. Ren should be witty. I think she doesn't want to get her bratty persona exposed so she used him as a scapegoat. \n\t\t\t\t- would she feel bad about this? probably and might apologize but this would seed the misbelief; people cannot be trusted, even his own family member. \n\t\t\t\t\t- this feels bit weak I feel like the third one should have the nail in the coffin to drive this home. would the merchant one? I think [[nanowrimo/202204/the merchant training - draft 1|merchant]]  training one is in the middle where it helps to solidify that someone else lies. also this builds up on why Ben would be wary to meet another dwarf merchant in the first chapter, he's met one before with his family and that's when his family member was duped. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t-  [ ] I need to write a summary of the story flow of that so I can edit it better for the context. \n\t- I think they would get lost in the woods, the Iron Woods where it's known for elves to hunt humans for slavery and just because they see humans as a pest of nature. 🔥\n\t- so what would be the immediate threat if the elves are the looming threat? would they be saved by someone or Ren ran away and ben is left behind since he's a younger one? \n\t\t**- [[nanowrimo/202204/Protagonist design - Ben Wiles|Ben Wiles]] would be 9 and Ren would be 13 that means Ollie would be 11, perfect!!**\n\n# So let's recap on that running just now:\nWhen Ben was 9 him and his older sister Ren goes into the Iron Woods for a race but ended up getting lost and they are left to argue and some of the inner Ren would come out but when they are rescued by the searchers Ren turns on Ben but Marney stays by his side and he talks to Marney that he has no one to rely on at his house but Marney since she listens to him all the time.\n\n**to do:** \nfigure out what the immediate threat is, be it wolves or something that would stalk or chase them that would cause escalation and ended up getting lost. I think wolves might work but something even greater would be better? I don't know something fantastical to show that there's more than just wild animals are there to harm them. \n\nRen wound goad Ben for a race despite she's got a racing horse while Ben's got a workhorse. I think this would come in handy that Marney is a workhorse and able to drag things twice her weight in comparison to racing horse.  A Iron Tree falls and blocks a path back home and Marney suggests Ben to make her drag the wood away? why would a tree fall? Iron Wood Elf's trap? while they were running away from something in the woods? \n\nIron Wood Elves, they are protecting their forest from humans who comes to the woods to harvest the prized ironwoods and sets up alarms and traps to ward their forest and the two triggers it. here Ben would notice this but his sister would not and this places him in a position to know something but neglected yet again.","lastmodified":"2022-04-21T09:06:27.023704507Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/nanowrimo-20220401prompt1":{"title":"Daily Prompt - 20220401","content":"## Sprinting duration: 5 min\n## Prompts: \ntry to write with the following words.\n- [x] jester \n- [ ] glitch \n- [x] prank \n- [x] fanciful \n\n## Just write!\nThere's a fanciful way of pulling a prank these days compared to what we did in the past since this is the age of communication and there are so many things we could do with it compared to a court jester would make fun of themselves in front of the king in the king's court.

Ben was healthy and he had all the love and attention from his grandfather. Ollie was going to be the heir for the merchant business of the family and to make up for his lack of health he made up with his brilliant intellect and there was no dispute about how much smarter he was compared to Ben. He was analytical and thoughtful. it was admiring how calm and collected he was all the time despite he's just 2 years older than himself. \n\nThere was a time when their father was taking his sons to the market to teach them the art of barter and appraisal of goods. Ben accompanied his father and his brother as if he was an appendix because his father's gaze was always on Ollie rather than at Ben, teaching him the basics of reading the scales and talking to fellow merchants. Ollie was spared from doing small errands as his frail body won't last if he was running around the market area so it always fell on Ben's laps. \n\nOne time he was watching deal of some precious metal trade and the man was passing around the object to inspect them. their father was reminded the two boys to pay close attention. they were weighing the ingot on the scale and the father was holding it to inspect it and requested the merchant whether his boys can have a look at the ingot themselves.\n\nthe father gave the boys his own ingot  about the same size and explained about using your own reference to do the deal. so both of them were able to hold the ingots on each hand to compare. When Ben held them, there was this weird tingling sensation on his fingertips that he couldn't express with his words. Something about the two ingots were different. It was about the same size and same weight. both had passed the scratch test to see if it was simply coated or the real deal. But something was off in Ben's hands as if something was not natural about it.

This would be the first time I would accompany him and my brother to an actual trade. It was also the time when I started to have this weird tingling sensation in my fingertips whenever touched objects and felt something about them. I still can't really tell what these are but it's something I had a way of perceiving things my family members could not. I just wasn't sure whether that was a good or for the bad until this day.\n\nThe place was underground, barely lit with lanterns, the only light was the candle on the stony table and across sat a bearded man, a dwarf. He was about my height but thrice my girth and beard that covered half of his view, a thick brown braided with polished bronze rings, engraved with small crossed axes. My father, Kenneth Wiles sat across from him, tall wry man with steely gray eyes with thin lips to at least show he is grinning at the person across from you. But you can tell his eyes are like a hawk preying on his target looking for weakness. He gives that looks to everyone, even to me and Ollie. \n\nMy brother Ollie was standing on the right side of my father, slightly behind him and able to look over the table while I was on Ollie's right, behind him barely coming up to his height. My brother was weak from birth and despite two years older than myself, when standing next to him we were about the same size and maybe I was slightly bigger than him. What he lacked in physical he made it up for the mind. He ha the keen insight as my father did and sure he loved that compared to me. He was a brilliant chess player, also my father's favorite pass time activity. I never once won a match against him. \n\nThey were trading some goods, because we were away from the main city coins had very little worth or wasn't really the effective tool for the trade so they ended up bartering. 'understanding the value of the goods are essential and what's greater is to understand its leverage against yours versus theirs.' my father repeatedly say to my brother and I. He wasn't so appreciative of me, I wasn't sure what it was back then, I wanted to look as good as my brother was but the things he looked for wasn't there in me. I wasn't keen, smart, but I had health. I know I'm not the first choice as a heir to the family trade and a substitute if anything happens to my brother and by gods I hope that day never comes. but sometimes I wished that was the case but that's for another time.\n\n\"So, mister Wiles, I heard that you have acquired some fine barrels of reserves from Fort Eisenfort as the rumors say, it's been a while since I left my hometown and had a sip of that special reserves.\" the dwarf pursed his lips and grinned at Ollie and I. \n\n\"Yes and I heard the mining here has been very profitable and you're willing to part with some of them for some barrels of them?\" \n\n\"Your hearings are correct mister Wiles, I can show you some of the ingots we have processed, it was a stroke of luck we hit some load here...\"\n\n\"You may skip with the introduction, I just would like to examine them and compare with my tools.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course, as a fellow merchant you should always examine your goods. Are these lads your apprentices?\"\n\n\"They're here to observe the process.\" My father curtly answered as he took out a small wooden chest filled with scale and weights. He also took out a small ingot of gold from his pocket and placed it on the table along side the tools. The dwarf also took out a similar sized ingot, it must have been a standard thing to create a ingot like this for comparison.\n\nMy father wasted no time to measure the ingots. first he weighted his own ingot, then the dwarf's. the ingots were about the same size and weight. I could see a slight curl on my father's lips. then he picked up a small pick to press firmly onto the both ingots and compared the indentation. There was some pause and he looked at my brother, who was observing the proceedings in silence. he rewarded him by passing the ingots, he glanced over the dwarf to get an approval, and he nodded back. \n\nOllie held the ingots each in his hands and compared the weights and its size. then leaned closer to the ingots and compared the indentations father made on both. Ollie looked at my way and looked back at my father. \n\n\"Can he examine too?\" he requested. \n\"Yes please?\" I couldn't hold my tongue and spoke up, that was a mistake. My father's thin smile faded, cold grey gaze shredded my excitement in a flash.\n\"Yes let the lad examine it, more training for him no?\" The dwarf insisted and that dispelled the icy stare from my father and he smiled back at the dwarf.\n\"Of course, he can examine it, I just don't want to keep you here too long.\" my father agreed and nodded at Ollie.\n\nthe ingots were dropped in my hands, they were lot heavier than I expected them to be. *So this is what gold weight feels like.* I thought, but there was something more to it. They're about the same shape and size, crudely shaped bar with rough surfaces and my father's bar had a seal imprinted on it; a scale with wolf's head and goods. But something was different for sure.\n\nI could never express them with words, it's like a tingling sensation on my finger tips. the best way I can explain it is like dipping my finger in the flowing water. when I move my fingers I can feel the tingling sensation, some are heavy, some are mild. there are places that snags my fingertip as if there's an invisible hook to it and I feel like I can tug it like it's a knot I can unravel if I pull it. It was more recent thing and I haven't brought it up to anyone so far. \n\nThe dwarf's ingot had gave more tingling sensation than my father's, with more resistance when I moved my fingers along the bar. There were places where knots were seemingly in a pattern, I focused on the pattern by running my thumb along the sides and making a comparison.\n\n\"Are you done?\" I jolted at my father's voice and looked up and greeted with his irritated look with his hand in front of me. I placed both ingots on his hand. I glanced over to Ollie and he nodded with a wary smile and motioned his eye towards the dwarf. The dwarf's beady eyes were boring at me across the table, fixated at my fingers as if I'm doing something wrong. His stony expression relaxed when  I handed the ingots back at my father.\n\n\"Very keen apprentices you have there mister Wiles.\" He chuckled and scratched his head before taking the ingot back.\n\"They feel different.\" I muttered, Ollie widened his eyes and my father frowned.\n\"What did I instruct you before we entered the place?\" he questioned and kept his cool.\n\"You said they're the same, but they're different.\" I insisted. If he was about to make a deal this was not a fair trade since they're not the same. I wanted to help and I felt I know something my father and Ollie doesn't that would help. \n\"Disregard the errand boy, we will have a talk after this.\" He quelled my suggestion with sharp words and I stopped, I felt like I was embarrassing him in public. My brother leaned closer to whisper.\n\"What are you doing, you trying to get punished again?\" he whispered, semi panicking.\n\"But it's true, they feel different, can't you feel it?\"\n\"No the only difference I see is the stamp on our father's ingot. we're here to observe in silence remember?\" he nudged lightly at the word remember. Yes I do remember but I felt it's bad to lie when I notice the difference. But for speaking up now I am in trouble, probably. Our father ignored our whispers and resumed the transaction.\n\n\"Yes, shall we craft a contract?\" my father requested and before the dwarf's agreement he opened up a scroll case on his waist and pulled out a piece of scroll and unfurled it on the table, holding them open with two pieces of iron bars. his index fingertip faintly glimmered and he placed his fingertip on to the paper and words started to flow from this ring on his finger and snaked its way onto the paper and left trails of words as his finger skimmed along.  \n\n\"Ah are you a weaver?\" the dwarf asked and wiped his forehead, while his eyes traced the words. \n\"No, just enough to use some of the weave forged goods.\" he passed the finished draft and passed to the dwarf, who was putting on his own ring on his index finger and examined the contract with a nod of approval. \n\"I've heard the founding Wiles is a skilled weaver. \" the dwarf added as he took out a red wax and a seal. our father mirrored him. \n\"Wild accusations, in my years with him, I have never seen him weaving anything other than lighting his pipe.\" he jested. \"Where did you hear such tales from?\"\n\"Wiles senior is rather well known in Eisenfort, I'm surprised you are unaware.\" he chuckled as he made a copy of the contract and sealed both of them before passing it back to our father. \n\"Perhaps I would inquire from him once I see him.\" he replied, examined the copy and sealed both of them. I know his words are empty. He never talks to grandfather, like he never talks to me unless there's a good reason, which I am going to have after this. I wished this moment would last longer because I was not looking forward to what he was about to say to me.\n\nBoth sealed the papers and shook hands and we left the dark underground dwelling. Ollie silently followed and I was behind my brother carrying the small chest with the ingots inside. When we exited, some of my father's men were rolling barrels down the caravan and into the stone carved building. I wanted to drop this chest and join the rest of the workers to hide away from my father's looming threat. I walked behind him and Ollie and I both knew we're both going to be in trouble.\n\n\"What did I tell you before we entered?\"\n\"Be silent and watch.\" both of us said in unison.\n\"Correct, was that so difficult?\" He raised his voice a bit, looking out the small caravan window. We did not answer. Both of us looked at our feet and exchanged glances. I know I should be scolded since I spoke up but my brother didn't do anything.  I pursed my lips.\n\"No, and we won't do that again.\" Ollie said it before I could. \n\"Soon I will let you do some of the transactions yourself, right now you're just watching my son.\" He answered to Ollie. I felt left out.\n\"You're lucky that your brother is looking out for you all the time, be sure to be his good muscle when he starts his own trade.\" It was always him and I'm left to pick up the crumbs of my brother's greatness. Always. \n\"Why can't I be my own merchant?\" I spoke up looking up at my father, his face twisted and flushed with anger.\n\"Remember child, you're an insurance for family heir, know your place.\" He snapped at me and waved his hand to dismiss. \"Olianous, you're staying to recite what you have learned from the transaction.\" He added and snatched the chest from my hands. \n\nThat's when I felt the snag in my fingertips, the invisible knots got caught and pulled and unravelled around my finger as I can feel it tickling my fingers before it dropped down to the floor.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.
