I never had the chance to do an extensive work on the world but worked on it whenever I wanted to run away from the real world and get myself lost in my fantasy world.  That fantasy world opened up to a whole new vista when I shared the world with other people to play table top roleplaying games. \n\n2020 presented an interesting proposal I could not refuse, I was stuck at home like many of us and I had too much time to ask myself the questions I haven't been asking myself for years; How is my world doing? I also had an opportunity to run a lot of Dungeons and Dragons online with many groups and was able to reconstruct my world again and since I have more time I started to wonder whether I can write a short story about it.... But where do I start?\n\nWhat initially started as my new knowledge management system (KMS) ended up being used as my personal knowledge base for D\u0026D and all the lore I have created. [Obsidian](http:www.obsidian.md) is the said system and I fell in love with and the discord community. There I learned about [NaNoWriMo](http:www.nanowrimo.org) with their annual writing challenges and I decided to join the community to write something with a solid beginning and and end. \n\nThis website came to be to share some of my writings with my community, learn bit more about coding in my spare time and sharing some of my writing journey here.\n\n### First day of April FOOLS, I mean NaNoWriMO actually. \nI joined the [Virtual Write-in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utW1-FHDTOE\u0026t=5s\u0026ab_channel=NaNoWriMo), thank you Katherine for the wonderful facilitation, to learn more about what is going on during the writing camp. It was a bit daunting at first but nonetheless exciting to participate in my first group writing sessions without feeling like this is some sort of essay I have to turn for an English exam. English is my second language and writing is my nemesis for my entire academic life, and still is today. Curse you articles why thou art exist? But the facilitation was smooth and the topics were refreshing for me to think about what I'm going to write - not entirely - to think from my potential character's perspective with writing prompts. I clocked in 800+ words in on the story I wanted to develop on. Plus the side writing I did that was not part of the project scope it slowly rolled towards 2000 words today in total. I never tracked how many words I write a day on a daily basis other than just writing it for fun for my D\u0026D so this was rather exciting to track it for once. As for my activity you can check out how I am doing [from here.](nanowrimo/202204/Introduction.md)\n\n### Reading List\nI am going rather slow since I am trying to read other books in the meantime to learn how to write and edit it going forward and the current books I'm reading are:\n1.

I honestly don't know how much time I spend on writing my own stories till I started. \n\nI'm starting to see there's some lag time when I write. I am trying to think about the structure and the direction but I can't seem to do that clearly. the guide asks what the goal of the scene is it's rather hard to nail it in the first writing especially with my approach of writing. What is my approach?\n\nI wrote some prompt yesterday and I thought it would be nice to continue on to build up on it. on both occasions I had to think for a bit before I was writing them and that was a good 3 to 5 min thinking before my fingers started to move to write them. Unlike yesterday today I was thinking to write them with some goal in mind, seed some misbelief in the protagonist but I struggled to come up with it and decided to just write down whatever that was coming to me and see what I ended up with. \n\nTurns out it's messy and all over the place as my brain wasn't thinking in a linear structure but it just constantly branches and I needed to make sure I write them down else I will forget and this made it really difficult for me to stay focused on the writing a clear flow of story. However I was able to flesh out the things around the story itself. It did take a while before I was able to nail down what the misbelief should be given to the protagonist and in the end it was refreshing to know that I can write about 600 words in about 30 minutes with some time slated for thinking. \n\n# D\u0026D is easier than writing, I swear.\nSo I run D\u0026D sessions on Mondays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Yes that is a lot and I love it. The biggest challenge would be coming up with the content and so far I only had handful of occasions where I was stuck with the content and asked for a break only once or twice in my 2 years, going third thanks covid, or running 4 to 5 campaigns a week. How you might ask? Well here's the reason why,\n\n## D\u0026D is a collaborative storytelling\nI'm not the sole writer of the story, my role as a game master (GM/DM) is to create a setting and conflict for the players to interact with and whatever happens happens. there fore I don't have to think about what each of actors on the setting are thinking about. Yes I do have to think about the non-player character (NPC) responses and personas and all but it's rather easier to craft them compared to what I am doing for the writing itself. Plus a lot of them are improv storytelling at the time of the session with some seeds so I do not plan the entire thing. Because if I plan too much then it feels scripted and feel like I should force the story to follow that script. \n\nThe other part of the equation of D\u0026D is the players they get to see the setting  and the conflict I have created and figure out ways to resolve them if they wish to or just leave it as is. \n\nTake today's group for instance, they're currently in a two island with five settlements each run by a cloud giant. They are going around to understand what is happening in each of the settlement and they have learned so far.\n\n- Voracious cloud giant - slave driver for incense sales and having issues with a group a religious group focusing on happiness\n- Warmongering cloud giant - frequently hosts blood sports to pick out raiders to raid neighbouring settlements to loot and looking for which settlement to raid.\n- Passive cloud giant - taking care of the people on his settlement and moving further inland to protect the people from warmongering sibling and the village is suffering from a magical plague.\n- Mercantile cloud giant - amasses wealth through trade with other islands to keep the village thriving and have hired foreigners to live in a city to protect his assets.\n- Religious cloud giant - yet to be revealed.\n\n There's no right answer what the players would be doing in the islands but they are thinking of what they are going to do to either help out the people in the islands by taking a side. Right now they're thinking of taking out some of the giants and help them to create a council of giants to unite them. As a GM I am talking to them out of character (OOC) to bounce ideas back and forth not to plot but to think about npc responses and checking with each of their goals to see if it aligns. ___My goal is to create an interesting story with them___. \n\n## Sometimes I do nothing, seriously nothing.\nSo it's a collaborative storytelling and sometimes, GM doesn't need to be involved at all to have fun. I'm just there to do some rulings on how things will be settled. Here's on example happened today.\n\nI have given the party a bag of tricks, which allows you to summon animals that lasts for a day or until killed, three times a day, in previous island expedition. One of the player asked about how does it work, where are those animals are from and where do they go once the duration expires. We had some discussions on what it might be and after some discussion we have collectively arrived that.\n\n- The bag of tricks have three spirits that will manifest in an animal form for a day at random, unless they're all summoned at once.\n\t- these spirits have personalities and they are Dumb / Haughty / Loyal inspired by the three hyenas from the Lion King. \n\nIt was all players discussion and I was steering the conversation in some directions and they make the calls and I just set that as the rules of the bag of tricks. \n\nIt's lot easier for me to write the setting and wait for the players to interact and fill in the gaps. I am struggling to write a short story based on my campaign settings and I'm spending most of my time on thinking about what is going on each of the character's head - **or I'm just overthinking it**.","lastmodified":"2022-04-03T08:15:09.363351408Z","tags":null},"/moc/NaNoWriMo":{"title":"NaNoWriMo","content":"Currently it's just one but I plan to do more of these NaNoWriMo going forward.\n\n[INaNoWriMo April 22](nanowrimo/202204/Introduction.md)","lastmodified":"2022-04-03T08:15:09.363351408Z","tags":null},"/moc/Worldbuilding-Index":{"title":"Worldbuilding Index","content":"This is where I put things for worldbuilding, rules and stuff.\n\n[[worldbuilding/Worldbuilding - Magic]]","lastmodified":"2022-04-03T08:15:09.363351408Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/Activity-History":{"title":"Activity History","content":"```ActivityHistory\n/\n\n```","lastmodified":"2022-04-03T08:15:09.363351408Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/Brainstorm":{"title":"Brainstorm","content":"## Goal\nComing up with a character interaction scene for some of my character. that is under 4k words. - I have modified it so there will be three scenes in the actual writing to make it easier perhaps I would change it later on should it gets too wordy.\n\n- [Story Overview](nanowrimo/202204/Story%20Overview.md)\n- [Protagonist design - Ben Wiles](nanowrimo/202204/Protagonist%20design%20-%20Ben%20Wiles.md)","lastmodified":"2022-04-03T08:15:09.363351408Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/Introduction":{"title":"Introduction","content":"---\n\n![Camp NaNoWriMo 2022 - Writer - Facebook Banner](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.wordpress.nanowrimo.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/16123816/Camp-Nano_Writer-Banner_FB_300dpi.png)So it begins, my first National November Writer's Month Camp!

The merchant wasn't telling them the truth. The merchant squinted and disregarded Ben's comment and Ben's persistence angered Kenneth, he informed Ben is misbehaving and the gold ingot passed all the usual tests, the scratch test and weight. He insisted but he was scolded and escorted out of the negotiation by Ollie and the transaction happened without him. \n\nLater they find out the gold bar was magically modified, it had lead and weight was modified by the use of magic to behave like one. \n\n:: I think the transaction should be a barter between something against the gold as they were out of Port Distance and the port distance's coins would be ineffective in  where they are meaning they might be somewhere far up north  near the mountainside by the mining area for the gold ingots for probably for something else,  Essienfort reserves perhaps?

But now he's old now and it's just who knows whether you can believe this old man setting in more ways than none. Plus he doesn't weave as much as others would, it's not like he is able to weave it perfectly other than some parlor tricks and the family doesn't really consider themselves to be a weaver nor they have it in the family. \n\n::This could be a lie in the world where everyone can weave but they need to be trained or requires a foci for them to perform one or just straight up weaving is dangerous the easiest way to weave is through devotion and oath to a patron.::\n\n**The goal for this background is for him is to have a misbelief to not to trust his intuition of weaving but more on his head. This builds up to the lie of trusting people as he would steel himself to think about other's true intentions behind their actions.** \n\nThe fact that is his relationship with Ollie is teneous as is and this just exasperates even further since Ollie stays in because he's being trained to be the successor to the family trade while Ben was a tag along and a gopher for errands. :: age might be in his 14 or so?::\n\nThen the solidification of not trusting someone would be falling in love with someone as Ben would have more freedom to explore whatever he wants to do compared to Ollie and Ren?","lastmodified":"2022-04-03T08:15:09.363351408Z","tags":null},"/nanowrimo/202204/nanowrimo-20220401prompt1":{"title":"Daily Prompt - 20220401","content":"## Sprinting duration: 5 min\n## Prompts: \ntry to write with the following words.\n- [x] jester \n- [ ] glitch \n- [x] prank \n- [x] fanciful \n\n## Just write!\nThere's a fanciful way of pulling a prank these days compared to what we did in the past since this is the age of communication and there are so many things we could do with it compared to a court jester would make fun of themselves in front of the king in the king's court.

I had so many voice recordings where it picked up people in the mid sentence or worse when they realized that they've been talking to themselves for a good 20 seconds.

Ben was healthy and he had all the love and attention from his grandfather. Ollie was going to be the heir for the merchant business of the family and to make up for his lack of health he made up with his brilliant intellect and there was no dispute about how much smarter he was compared to Ben. He was analytical and thoughtful. it was admiring how calm and collected he was all the time despite he's just 2 years older than himself. \n\nThere was a time when their father was taking his sons to the market to teach them the art of barter and appraisal of goods. Ben accompanied his father and his brother as if he was an appendix because his father's gaze was always on Ollie rather than at Ben, teaching him the basics of reading the scales and talking to fellow merchants. Ollie was spared from doing small errands as his frail body won't last if he was running around the market area so it always fell on Ben's laps. \n\nOne time he was watching deal of some precious metal trade and the man was passing around the object to inspect them. their father was reminded the two boys to pay close attention. they were weighing the ingot on the scale and the father was holding it to inspect it and requested the merchant whether his boys can have a look at the ingot themselves.\n\nthe father gave the boys his own ingot  about the same size and explained about using your own reference to do the deal. so both of them were able to hold the ingots on each hand to compare. When Ben held them, there was this weird tingling sensation on his fingertips that he couldn't express with his words. Something about the two ingots were different. It was about the same size and same weight. both had passed the scratch test to see if it was simply coated or the real deal. But something was off in Ben's hands as if something was not natural about it. Ben said they're different and the merchant's ingot felt unnatural.\n\nThe merchant laughed off and wanted to rush to close the transactions.\n\n[[continues on part 2]]","lastmodified":"2022-04-03T08:15:09.363351408Z","tags":null},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`.

It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n🔗 [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.*\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.\n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`.\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!
