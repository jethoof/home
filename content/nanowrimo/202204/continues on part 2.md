Ben wasn't sure what it was but he pushes to his father that there's something off about the gold bars, they weren't exact but he wasn't sure how to tell them other than his fingertips told him it's different. The merchant wasn't telling them the truth. The merchant squinted and disregarded Ben's comment and Ben's persistence angered Kenneth, he informed Ben is misbehaving and the gold ingot passed all the usual tests, the scratch test and weight. He insisted but he was scolded and escorted out of the negotiation by Ollie and the transaction happened without him. 

Later they find out the gold bar was magically modified, it had lead and weight was modified by the use of magic to behave like one. 

:: I think the transaction should be a barter between something against the gold as they were out of Port Distance and the port distance's coins would be ineffective in  where they are meaning they might be somewhere far up north  near the mountainside by the mining area for the gold ingots for probably for something else,  Essienfort reserves perhaps? I think the other merchant is a dwarf or something so it seeds the whole doubt about meeting Domalin in the scene itself and he hasn't seen an honest dwarf merchant in this life::

Kenneth sealed the deal and took the ingot back to Port Distance sell it for other trade goods with Lawrence Trading Company only to learn what Ben was saying was true but he never finds out the significant loss of the trade :: I think about 10% loss? ::.

What would have happened to Ben? I think he would have been punished somehow for talking to the adults and speaking out of turn in a serious negotiation. This in turn makes him he doubts himself about his intuition despite it's the right choice and this is due to him being attuned to the weaving ::magic:: but he's not aware of it. the connection is due to his grandfather is a weaver and is able to use it for his own benefits.  The last name isn't really a thing but it was given to the family due to this grandfather with his schemes, perhaps it's a good or bad thing but it's there and Lugris used it liberally to a point that it got stuck. But now he's old now and it's just who knows whether you can believe this old man setting in more ways than none. Plus he doesn't weave as much as others would, it's not like he is able to weave it perfectly other than some parlor tricks and the family doesn't really consider themselves to be a weaver nor they have it in the family. 

::This could be a lie in the world where everyone can weave but they need to be trained or requires a foci for them to perform one or just straight up weaving is dangerous the easiest way to weave is through devotion and oath to a patron.::

**The goal for this background is for him is to have a misbelief to not to trust his intuition of weaving but more on his head. This builds up to the lie of trusting people as he would steel himself to think about other's true intentions behind their actions.** 

The fact that is his relationship with Ollie is tenuous as is and this just exasperates even further since Ollie stays in because he's being trained to be the successor to the family trade while Ben was a tag along and a gopher for errands. :: age might be in his 14 or so?::

Then the solidification of not trusting someone would be falling in love with someone as Ben would have more freedom to explore whatever he wants to do compared to Ollie and Ren?
