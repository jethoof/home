The trees around me grew taller and grew teeth and claws, it began to stare down at me and the trunks started to crowded near me as if they are closing in. Marney kept her calm coming to a slow stop in the middle of the encircle. I tightened the grip on the reins, I could feel the stare and distant whispers of sort. I felt my shudder from fear and paralyzed neck down. I started to sweat. It must be them. The elves. 

"Marney we need to go after Ren," I mumbled and Marney took few steps back and slowly turned around. I think she knew exactly what was going on. my breathing got faster s the forest closed in on me and all I could do is hold onto Marney with my dear life. Trust she can take me out of this place.

Then the silence broke as a dark figure from the forest lunged and broke through the thickets. I braced myself for impact. Instead, long auburn hair broke the paralysis gripped my body. It was Ren. She was covered in scratches and her dress was torn from running through the bush. She abruptly stopped in front of me. I could hear the labored breathing from Ren and Petunia. 

"Ben, snap out of it. We're leaving,, now," She ordered and I blanked out and Marney neighed as if she understood her words. Ren's presence did war my fingertips and shaking stopped but I was still stiff as a plank. 

"Useless... Ben, wake up. There's something in the forest and it doesn't want us here," She explained calmly and came closer to brush my hair and held my stiff hands. Her hands were warm and soft but I felt mild shaking as well. She, too, was afraid of what was going on around. Ren kept her cool about it, maybe because I was here or did it to dispel the dread looming over out head. She grabbed the rein from my hands and whipped Marney with it. the work pony started advance slowly and picked up the pace and Petunia lead the way. 

The sun was staining the sky orange by the time we existed the forest and greeted with men with lanterns. Out father was among them, furious  and even more once he saw us. Ren and I were in a sorry state but Ren had it worse, torn dress and scratches. I was relatively fine since Marney took careful strides in the forest to avoid any scratches. 

"Explain yourselves," Our father demanded back at the stables. I've never seen him this angry before. The last time he was this mad was when Ollie broke his leg from a fall while we were playing guards and bandits. I was grounded for weeks and did chores around the house while my brother recovered. Ren already changed and her scratches were covered with herbal balms. I was still in the same clothing, sitting by the fire with holding onto a wooden mug with hot water. Ren and I exchanged glances. 

"Ben wanted to explore the forest."

"Why did you not stop him?"

"I wanted too as well until he got scared and we got lost in the woods. We came back alive and well so all is well?" Ren made it sound like a question mark. *That's not how it happened*, I interjected in my head, instead I gave Ren a look of confusion. Older sister did not bat an eye at me. 

"Watch your tongue, not all is well. Both of you disobeyed the rule of not entering the forest unattended. You know the place is close to the elven border and rumors of them taking children," Father rubbed his temples and kneeled to Ren to inspect her balm covered face. He must be wondering whether there will be scars on her face.

"The high courting starts in two weeks, and you need to look your best. no blemishes. And you child. I expected you to be more disciplined than your elder sister."

I looked at my father and opened my mouth to think of a good response, especially the truth. Then my sister spoke before me.

"Do not punish him father, he merely wanted to prove his riding skills. You should have seen him, he wove through the thicket, unlike clumsy me. And worry not father, these scars are light and won't leave any scratch. Perhaps the imperfection would be something to be desired, an element that requires taming by my future suiter." 

"Tongue daughter, is this true?" He inquired me and I saw a glimpse of Ren staring at me with a nod. I should answer honestly else only I would get in trouble. At the same time I know I won't be able to speak my way out against my older sister. She's four seasons ahead of me but her oration is leagues ahead of me. The most likely outcome would be more severe punishment should I speak up against her and father usually prefers her over me. I fiddle my thumbs around the mug and slowly nod.

Father lets out a long drawn out sigh, combing his hair back and stands up.

"No more horseback riding for both of you. Benarious help out stablemaster until the end of the moon after your apprenticeship with carpenter Melk.  Be grateful of your sister came to rescue you."

I just blankly looked up before father stood up and left the stables, Ren loosened her posture and started to tie her hair.

"Thanks for sticking with my story," She thanked.

"You owe me."

"Yea, but I knew you wouldn't. I'm sure part of the things I said were true."

She was right about the proving my skills, perhaps the only thing I'm good at. I didn't want her to be right.

"You're wrong. "

"Bet your pony Marney that you are proud of your pony and better at handling them."

I did not answer.

Father's punishment was mild, in a sense it was more of a reward as I had more time in the stables with Marney. Whatever happened in the forest I don't think I would have gotten out without her back then and she's the only reliable being in the household.
