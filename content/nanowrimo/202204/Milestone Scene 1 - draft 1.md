Ben gains misbelief about note trusting someone? 
Ben interacts with someone who had their own intention to use ben as a means to benefit them instead and leave him on the side once the  goals are achieved, his father comes into let him know that there's not even a single being to trust, including his family members because everyone's out for themselves and if he cannot grasp that then he won't be able to be a good merchant.

perhaps this is also imbued to Ollie as well and this is the first time Ollie is also used it and felt bad? their belief's are being set up by their father?

what kind of trust should there be only to be destroyed? I think it has to be something simple like a trust that his older brother would be looking out for him but he didn't as they got older due to the teachings. relying on someone else is a foolish deed. 


Average work horse lives for 25 to 30 years so Ben might be getting his pony Marney and this is where he learns that only animals are to be trusted as they are simple and this could be from Ben's grandfather [[Lugris Wiles]]

Kenneth Wiles and Merona Overglade are Ben's parents.

Side: 
another backstory is the lack of harmony in the household and he learns that it's his grandfather arranged marriage between Ben's father and mother.
