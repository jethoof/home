"Can we please have something other than this stone tablet, I'm going to lose my teeth before we get to Kupferkrone." Higs lamented at the hardened bread tablet with a sullen stare.

"Then why don't you fetch yourself a hopper or something in the bush for all of us instead of crying?" Thimble slapped Hig's shoulder and sat next to him. She rifled through her backpack to take out the dust covered tablet bread, blew the dust off and snapped it in half.

"A decent meal would be nice," I agreed with Higs and joined the campfire after  feeding Marney the horse.

"We haven't had the time to hunt since we got on the cart," Geese stretched herself after starting the campfire. 

"But if we want to get to Kupferkrone before the crowning day, we can't waste any more time on the road. Luckily, we have Ben's cart and the horse to get there if we travel all day while the sun is up," Domalin used the hilt to break the bread and shoved the crumbs into his mouth.

"How's the horse doing?" Ishyldr questioned me without looking. he was fixing his bow and surveying the area.

"She might get cranky near the end but she will manage. we just can't put her in any more stress." I stared down at the tablet bread and tried to break it in half like Thimbles. No luck.

"Just three more days of this and we'll be done, no sweat. well the horse is doing all the work and there's been no sign of goblins so that's a relief." Domalin attempted to cheer the group.

"Can't you rangers hunt in the night and sleep on cart?" Higs suggested at Geese and Ishyldr.

"We could definitely go for something more tender than this. What do you think Iz... Ishlydr?" Geese turned to Ishyldr who was climbing up a tree.

"Absolutely not, under the usual circumstances, we could but we're short on time and we don't know whether those goblins are behind our trail." Domalin shut down the idea and looked up at the tree for Ishyldr's input. He simply nodded.

I saw Higs longingly staring at my stocks of honey. I knew exactly where his mind was rushing to.

"Ben, wanna trade my final payment for some of your honey right now?" Higs rubbed his hands together like some scavenger.
