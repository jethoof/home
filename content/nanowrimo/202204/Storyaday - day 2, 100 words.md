The goddess Silver Magpie had insatiable curiosity to uncover the hidden stories of the world. She flew across the world as a magpie with a silver tail feathers, collecting secrets of the world from farmers at the dinner table to the sages at the king's court. She rewarded them in secret with her blessings in a form of a silver feather. One day, her companions discussed the plans of reshaping the world to their liking. She told the denizens. For that, her soul was encased in quartz crystal and shattered into thousands of pieces and scattered across the world.
