Kyndral nodded and almost banged his head against the castle wall again. 
He let out a loud yawn and eyes droned to make sure no one would be coming 
to the garbage dump of the castle High Reach. On a typical day, he would not
 be stationed here but this is the lord's seventieth season and many from far 
and wide across the kingdom came to pay respect to the king. The place was a 
natural fortress and Kyndral wondered why anyone would build a castle in such 
a place, on top of the Mount Reach of the Jagged Mountains.The delegates across 
the realm, the eccentric food with taste rivaling its unpronounceable syllables 
and gifts of dreams and wonder for the king. The prince even summoned the divas 
from the Doraen peninsula, renown for their angelic vocals to fill the chambers.
But alas for Kyndral, a mere keyboard guard, a man who usually guards the room of keys,  
the only thing that's keeping him from this once-in-a-lifetime experience is the 
layers of cold stones, his duty and a heap of trash. He was tasked to guard the 
dump on this momentous day. Why? sheer luck of the draw. Nobody wanted to miss 
out on this garbage duty. He had advisors to thank for his luck. 
They were paranoid. 
Double, no triple the guards and post them on every nook and cranny. 
They even thought of an idea: an assassin may enter the castle through the garbage 
chute up to the kitchen and poison the king and his guests.They would have folded 
that crazy idea if they knew! The chute was a vertical drop at least ten person height, 
surrounded by sharp rocks. The only thing that passes the area are scraps of food 
and other unwanted waste from the castle's kitchen and wherever those dark tunnels 
are connected to within the castle. The castle High Reach is unreachable.
The bored guard looked over the heap of decadent food waste and imagined what the 
feast might even be like. He could make out a whole leg of a boar, barely eaten, 
a pile of vegetation with colors of rainbow.
'Must be nice, being a king and all,' Kyndral's daydream popped when he heard a 
female's scream from the maw of the chute. He rushed to inspect and saw a woman 
driving into the pile of garbage wrapped in a white blanket.
"Never returning to this shitty place ever again," the woman moaned and rolled out
 a food stained blanket. She wore servants' clothing but her voice and face Kyndral 
did not recognize. It was a divine blessing she came out unscathed. The woman had 
dark brown hair with emerald eyes.She was bewitchingly gorgeous. 
Their eyes met and she gave a coy smile.
"I've been fired in the most dramatic way possible, would you mind?" She waded her 
way through the trash and reached her hand out to ask for Kyndral‚Äôs help. 
'Must be a hired help for the event,' the guard thought and reached his hand out for the last time.
