Goal: Ben joins Domalin's group

I sat in front of the dwarf and felt like I'm about to enter a duel of board game with him and in fact that's how I exactly saw it. 

"pleasure to meet you mister Ben and based on your looks you're not a bee keeper." Domalin grinned and looked over the kitchen and the fireplace where other halflings are.

"Was it the height and you're not an arkwright from the looks of it" I joined the table  laid my sight on the ornate chest on the table.

"Everyone's a critic, but this one will fetch a good fortune once we deliver it."

"Give us a result and maybe I'll change my mind." Thimble cut in but her hand gets slapped away from the chest in Domalin's arms.
