Goal: Ben joins Domalin's group

I sat in front of the dwarf and felt like I'm about to enter a duel of board game with him and in fact that's how I exactly saw it. 

"pleasure to meet you mister Ben and based on your looks you're not a bee keeper." Domalin grinned and looked over the kitchen and the fireplace where other halflings are.

"Very much so, was it the height gave away, however seems like you are far more interesting than myself," I gestured to the rest of the members on the table I just joined then laid my sight on the ornate chest on the table.

"Ah this is something I can trade if you have the coins for it but I doubt you'll have enough." He chuckled and tugged the chest closer to him.
