<h1 id=what-would-be-the-goal-for-this-writing-today>what would be the goal for this writing today?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Ben believes no people can b trusted but animals they are honest</li>
<li>this is where he solidifies Marney is his only true friend.</li>
<li>there should be some sort of betrayal from a humanoid that would break his trust but the animal companion would not.
<ul>
<li>would this be something along the lines of abandonment in a desperate situation while the Marney pulled through alongside Ben and he is able to get out of the situation?</li>
<li>would he be able to use his weaving to get out of the situation or would this ruin the situation?
<ul>
<li>from my exploration I have defined that Ben would be a unraveler, one who is good at dispelling tapestries of magic easier than others but he is untrained and mostly good at understanding its patterns rather than destroying them.
<ul>
<li>These are rare and not many are there who are keen on this skill to train Ben at this point in time - he would require a mentor should he learn this skill. But not right now for this segment of the story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think the betrayal might be Renarious, his older sister who abandons him not because she wanted to but due to situation
<ul>
<li>but why and what caused her to abandon him? is it something small or something rather dire?</li>
<li>who is Renarious?
<ul>
<li>She&rsquo;s the eldest, being born as the firstborn she&rsquo;s been forced to be the bargained off for strengthening the family&rsquo;s power by marrying someone with influence in the Port Distance, Kenneth Wiles would be doing such as his father has done and how his wife, Merona Overglade is like.</li>
<li>She&rsquo;s been trained to be submissive but in fact she&rsquo;s got quite a spiteful and manipulative, like her father&rsquo;s carbon copy. If she&rsquo;s not manipulating people then she would be planning to do so to benefit her.
<ul>
<li>She gets jaded about her future and openly pretends to accept but looking for her freedom and control over her destiny</li>
<li>would she have some magical powers? would this person be Destiny????
<ul>
<li>would she run away? no she wouldn&rsquo;t be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So it&rsquo;s a conflict between Renarious and Benarious with Marney involved. I think the story would be she wanted to race against Ben but loses and she does get spiteful and decides to pull a prank on him but gets out of hand by something happens.
<ul>
<li>what is that something? - let&rsquo;s find out by keep typing it out - did they get trapped somewhere due to Ren&rsquo;s recklessness but it&rsquo;s covered by her external persona to hide behind?
<ul>
<li>Who knows Ren&rsquo;s real persona? Ben and Ollie? perhaps. probably so this builds up on the context.</li>
<li>so they&rsquo;re stuck somewhere due to the fact that Ren overdid something and Ben followed her being the eldest but in the end Ben takes all the blame because Ren puts blame on him instead of her.
<ul>
<li>this would have happened when they were quite young. Ren should be witty. I think she doesn&rsquo;t want to get her bratty persona exposed so she used him as a scapegoat.
<ul>
<li>would she feel bad about this? probably and might apologize but this would seed the misbelief; people cannot be trusted, even his own family member.
<ul>
<li>this feels bit weak I feel like the third one should have the nail in the coffin to drive this home. would the merchant one? I think <a href=/home/nanowrimo/202204/the-merchant-training-draft-1 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/home/nanowrimo/202204/the-merchant-training-draft-1>merchant</a> training one is in the middle where it helps to solidify that someone else lies. also this builds up on why Ben would be wary to meet another dwarf merchant in the first chapter, he&rsquo;s met one before with his family and that&rsquo;s when his family member was duped.
<ul>
<li><input disabled type=checkbox> I need to write a summary of the story flow of that so I can edit it better for the context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I think they would get lost in the woods, the Iron Woods where it&rsquo;s known for elves to hunt humans for slavery and just because they see humans as a pest of nature. 🔥</li>
<li>so what would be the immediate threat if the elves are the looming threat? would they be saved by someone or Ren ran away and ben is left behind since he&rsquo;s a younger one?
<strong>- <a href=/home/nanowrimo/202204/Protagonist-design-Ben-Wiles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/home/nanowrimo/202204/Protagonist-design-Ben-Wiles>Ben Wiles</a> would be 9 and Ren would be 13 that means Ollie would be 11, perfect!!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=so-lets-recap-on-that-running-just-now>So let&rsquo;s recap on that running just now:</h1>
<p>When Ben was 9 him and his older sister Ren goes into the Iron Woods for a race but ended up getting lost and they are left to argue and some of the inner Ren would come out but when they are rescued by the searchers Ren turns on Ben but Marney stays by his side and he talks to Marney that he has no one to rely on at his house but Marney since she listens to him all the time.</p>
<p><strong>to do:</strong>
figure out what the immediate threat is, be it wolves or something that would stalk or chase them that would cause escalation and ended up getting lost. I think wolves might work but something even greater would be better? I don&rsquo;t know something fantastical to show that there&rsquo;s more than just wild animals are there to harm them.</p>
<p>Ren wound goad Ben for a race despite she&rsquo;s got a racing horse while Ben&rsquo;s got a workhorse. I think this would come in handy that Marney is a workhorse and able to drag things twice her weight in comparison to racing horse. A Iron Tree falls and blocks a path back home and Marney suggests Ben to make her drag the wood away? why would a tree fall? Iron Wood Elf&rsquo;s trap? while they were running away from something in the woods?</p>
<p>Iron Wood Elves, they are protecting their forest from humans who comes to the woods to harvest the prized ironwoods and sets up alarms and traps to ward their forest and the two triggers it. here Ben would notice this but his sister would not and this places him in a position to know something but neglected yet again.</p>
