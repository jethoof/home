<p>I liked rainy days, it always gave me the time to stay indoors and read about the history and the world rather than outside and doing some chores. Oh course, the chore always come to me since my eldest sister Ren is too dainty, Ollie is too frail and I&rsquo;m the most fit and the youngest.</p>
<p>However this was not the rainy day I get to do some house chores but the day I took up on my sister&rsquo;s challenge and got lost in the woods. But before I get there there&rsquo;s something you need to know about my sister.</p>
<p>Renarious Wiles, the eldest daughter of the Wiles family and the future mistress or wife to a man who is better off than my family. I think it was my father&rsquo;s disdain when he learned the first born was not a son. This fact was made clear to everyone in the family. I don&rsquo;t know whom he blames for this but he didn&rsquo;t waste time on his child upbringing and decided that she would be groomed to be a wife of another wealthier to strengthen the family&rsquo;s wealth, like his father did. So my sister Ren grew up rather spiteful but was well taught in manners and well versed in the local history to ensure she is desirable.</p>
<p>But Ollie and I knew, she was competitive and preferred to be less formal. She was given a doll while Ollie was given a sword. I was given a wooden tool set to learn about crafting. Ren demanded Ollie to teach her swordplay whenever she had the chance to be outside.</p>
<p>It was her 13th birthday when she was given a horse, to learn how to ride one along side Ollie since she demanded a lady should know how to ride a horse alongside her man. Father doted his daughter as much as he would for a bargaining chip and somehow this fancied him and he agreed. However, she quickly came to realization that horseback riding is something she did not excel.</p>
<p>I was not given a horse, my family had wealth but not that wealthy. Instead, I was given a workhorse to take care of, it was a new born from the stables of work horses we already had for pulling wagons. I named her Marney, after my grandmother&rsquo;s familiar. Marney and I got along really well since I had her as a pony and I knew her quirks. She expressed her stress by strutting he left hind feet and one way of calming her down stroking her head just behind her right ear. I think Marney understood me as well. She always neighed and nodded when I was talking to her as if she would answer to my words. This helped me when I had a chance to learn to ride alongside my siblings, I spent more time with Marney to a point I didn&rsquo;t really need to learn how to use the reins.</p>
<p>This frustrated Ren. She ways already frustrated she was bested by Ollie and this is the first time she got something she wanted that is outside of what a proper lady would do. I think she enjoyed it but she wasn&rsquo;t as skilled in handling the horse. She was too focused on ordering the horse rather than to understand it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Race me.&rdquo; Ren blurted out to me after our lessons were over and the instructor left the stables.
&ldquo;You know we&rsquo;re not suppose to ride after the lessons, besides they&rsquo;re tired from running around with us on their backs. We can do that some other time.&rdquo; I rebutted.
&ldquo;You will race me, Ollie&rsquo;s too worn out to ride anymore so you should do.&rdquo; Ren ordered and pointed at Ollie who was wiping the sweat off of his brows and barely controlling his breathing.
&ldquo;Ren, Ben&rsquo;s right you shouldn&rsquo;t else father would get upset it we ride outside of lesson and supervision.&rdquo; He added but Ren was already picking up the saddle pushed it to my chest.
&ldquo;Come on, it&rsquo;ll b short. Are you dismissing me because you&rsquo;re better than me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, I think you&rsquo;re a good rider.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then race me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have&mldr;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I do and saddle her up, we can tour around the forest and first one to return wins.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ren, the forest is dangerous, there might be elves nearby.&rdquo; Ollie mumbled.
&ldquo;Those tree lovers won&rsquo;t come down this close to the village. You&rsquo;re afraid of meeting some wood elves? They won&rsquo;t come near the town, they haven&rsquo;t come down this area in ten years.&rdquo; She quelled Ollie&rsquo;s fear and she was right. The wood elves haven&rsquo;t come down this far down in recent years and we have never seen them, just stories of them coming down and kidnapping children those who don&rsquo;t listen to their parents.
&ldquo;They might come to kidnap&mldr;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes they would love to snatch you away Benny and feed you to the wolves! They&rsquo;re just saying that so you don&rsquo;t wander around too far. The forest is safe. Or are you afraid?&rdquo; She goaded and I took it.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid, I go to the forest everyday!&rdquo; I muttered a bit, covering my fear by clenching on the saddle in my hand. Marney huffed and shook her head, she knew.
&ldquo;Great, you know the way around, so show me around the forest, while you prance around the forest I get to recite stupid poetry and walk around like a dainty little doll.&rdquo; she grabbed her horse&rsquo;s rein and stepped outside.</p>
<p>The clouds were gathering in the forest and the wind was whispering the weather&rsquo;s about to change. It is true I go to the forest almost everyday but that is only during fine days and always with by carpenter master.
&ldquo;Ren looks like it&rsquo;s about to rain so why not.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Get your dumb horse out here and show me around like a man.&rdquo; Ollie and I exchanged glances, he shook his head.</p>
<p>However some weird idea came up in my head. She was four years older than I so obviously she was smarter and stronger in every way, but I knew the forest and I know how to ride better than both of my siblings. I wanted to beat them in something for once. This was it. This was the chance to prove I am better than her in something. I patted Marney&rsquo;s side and tossed the saddle on her back, Marney looked up and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, help me prove that I can beat her in riding and I&rsquo;ll get you some carrots when the stable master&rsquo;s not looking,&rdquo; I coaxed her and it worked, her ears perked when she heard the word carrots and I led her outside. I double checked the saddle and gingerly got on.</p>
<p>Ren was already on her horse, she used her silver tongue to get a horse when the instructor was recommending a pony to get started since she&rsquo;s young and has a small frame. I think her reasoning was,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thirteen and Mrs. Bluemires informed I am ready to learn the etiquettes of the court and ready to present myself as a lady, hence I am a lady. A proper lady should ride a horse, not a pony, such would be disgraceful for a lady of Wiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would imagine that&rsquo;s about the way she went about it. The truth is more comical. she cannot mount the horse without a step ladder and her legs won&rsquo;t reach to the sides so she can&rsquo;t give a proper commands even if she wants to sprint. The only saving grace is Petunia, her horse, named after the birthmark on her forehead that looks like petunia flower, is the most calm horse in the Iron Glades she never throws a fit or panics, she gracefully trots in almost any situation and listens to the rider like it&rsquo;s the extension of their legs.</p>
<p>%% Oh the catastrophe is the death of Petunia and they have to get out of the situation.%%</p>
<p>Ren nodded when I joined her at the open field staring at the forest to the north.
&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
Ren kicked off like the wind, or at least Petunia did. I did catch the glimpse of my sister&rsquo;s unfettered glee filled with joy and excitement compared to her usual muted expression at home. This is the real Ren. This is the Ren she bottles up in the house and only reveal when she&rsquo;s our parents. I came to my sense and chased after her to the forest with Marney.</p>
<p>The air in the forest was heavier than usual, perhaps its' the weather but there was something else to it. I could feel someone was watching from a distance and the moment I turn my head to confirm the feeling disappeared. Ren paid no heed and was dashing through the bush recklessly. Her horse was keen on finding where the next solid footing should be before stepping. Marney on the other hand took her time and had the patience or uncertainty to double check her steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marney we&rsquo;re losing her, we could follow her steps instead.&rdquo; I conjectured but Marney flapped her eyes and shook adamantly as if to say she&rsquo;s not Petunia. Marney was still a pony, a work pony. She&rsquo;s got the power but not the grace nor the speed, and Petunia had all three. It wasn&rsquo;t long Ren&rsquo;s bright brown silhouette blended into foliage and vanished from the view.</p>
<p>We followed the tracks and kept our watchful eyes on the surroundings, the eerie stare from the distance continued to chase us and whenever I looked in the direction, the feeling faded. The tracks were clear but it was heading further up north, nearing the border of the borders. Beyond would mean entering the area of wood elves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister?&rdquo; I shouted but only the silence replied, not even the birds sang.</p>
