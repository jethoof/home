<p>Scene set up: Ben and Geese are on Marney and escaping the pursuit by the goblin riders. Ben is riding and Geese is behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed, you&rsquo;re really good at handling your friend.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The feeling&rsquo;s mutual, you&rsquo;re hands, off my chest, you can just hold me around the waist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She quickly heeded and I kicked the sides, sorry Marney I&rsquo;ll make it up to you afterwards. Shrieking arrow whooshed by cheek</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn to control your friend? Can you steady the motion for a second?&rdquo; She requested,</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we&rsquo;re catching our breath, Duck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geese my name is,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, DUCK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ducked and pulled whatever I can grab behind me as I took a sharp turn around a tree then jump down a small hump. I slowed down a bit to make sure Marney wasn&rsquo;t in a shock. I let go of my hand holding onto Geese and started to trot walking towards the thicket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you Marney and are you alright Geese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly fine, just keep going. I&rsquo;m just shocked, I never been on such creature&rsquo;s back before.&rdquo; Her voice quivered and I felt her weight on my back. I thought it must have been a shock, even for a seasoned hunter.</p>
<p>We crossed a stream and once crossed that&rsquo;s when I noticed her grip around my waist relaxed but her weight still on my back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geese?&rdquo; I asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have some minor issues.&rdquo; she spoke softly with heavy breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on let&rsquo;s find some shelter, we crossed the stream, they might be harder to pick up our trail here in the thickets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good choice, I saw some rock formation to the East, we might be able to find somewhere higher ground for a shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, hold on Geese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This moment I felt the roles have reversed, I am her savior right now and she&rsquo;s clinging onto me. There was something about the whole putting up the grave face and saving someone made my inside grumble. It wasn&rsquo;t a hunger for sure. I shook my head and focused on teh situation. Marney isn&rsquo;t built for sprints and this isn&rsquo;t my usual horse handling. What I also realized very quickly was I had no idea which direction was East.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geese, could you point me&mldr;&rdquo; I stopped when I Geese&rsquo;s arms around my waist dropped. Then I saw a black feathered arrow on her back. I almost fell from Marney and dragged her down to the ground immediately.</p>
<p>She was sweating and I was panicking wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do. Pull the arrow out or keep it in?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geese, you have an arrow on your back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Great, who to ask?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marney should I pull the arrow or not, neigh once for yes and twice for no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marney neighed once.</p>
<p>I laid Geese face down, placing my cloak on her face on the leaves covered ground and held the arrow and closed my eyes and yanked it out of her back. Geese woke up with a scream. the arrow was mixed with some black sticky substance and her blood. I think the arrow has poison but it kept her from bleeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, and welcome back. we have a big problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Izzy you came to save me, again.&rdquo; Geese smiled.</p>
<p>Great she&rsquo;s not her self, it must be the poison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geese you&rsquo;re poisoned and you&rsquo;re bleeding tell me what I need to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a test again?&rdquo; Her voice was soft and dreamy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s a test, what do you do when you have a poisoned arrow on your back and just pulled it out and you&rsquo;re bleeding out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;chew some tangle weed and plaster over the wound and suck out the bad blood. or was it in reverse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dae&rsquo;s Blood, I mean good, what does tangle weed look like and where do I find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You taught me this when I was a child, I&rsquo;m not a child anymore. would you stop with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you pass all this then I will treat you like a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;where is the weed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it in my belt pouch, but if not I would find it under shaded area usually under a bush,&rdquo; She giggled and the blood started to stain the leaves beneath her. I started to go through her belt and look for some dried herbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;suck the bad blood first then the weed, are we actually trying it? can I draw your blood out?&rdquo; she droned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do that on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;please be gentle.&rdquo; what are you thinking Geese this is a serious matter right now. I stared at the black blood slowly seeping out and I decided to suck it out with my mouth and spat them out far away as possible. She had a lot of pockets with little things; animal bones, some wax, jerky bits and a grinding stone. Then I finally found a pouch that rustled and had some dried herbs in there, I vigorously chewed and it soon started to swell and I placed it over to her wound and pressed on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Izzy&mldr;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben here please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When will you teach me to speak your tongue? Would I be ever good enough for you to be someone more than a child in your eyes?</p>
<p>What? I don&rsquo;t think this is something I should be listening to.</p>
<p>Izzy sometimes I just want you to treat me like your equal and more, like those humans we saw at the ringbay looking at each other intensely.</p>
<p>Not the right person nor the time Geese, I want you to wake up. your bleeding stopped but we&rsquo;re not out of the woods yet. those goblins might be still around stay with me.</p>
<p>I will stay with you.</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s not Ishyldr&rsquo;s slave but more like an apprentice she has feelings for?</p>
